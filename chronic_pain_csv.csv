1,PSA about generics and shortages,"Hello my wonderful pain ninjas! I am glad to see you're alive and kicking life's ass for another day. We have officially surpassed 18k subscribers, and I'm still conflicted whether or not that's a good thing...

I've been keeping track of drug shortages following Hurricane Maria devastating many drug manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico. Drug companies have consolidated their operations into fewer and fewer facilities, which means when one goes down... the supply chain gets fucked. 

With that said, your amazing awesome and stupid moderator's generics colors and shapes changed. Normally, a pharmacist should tell you that your generic changed, but I had a pharmacy intern who forgot to mention it. I'll give him a break, because we all have to start somewhere, and we all make mistakes. Because these generics changed, I have accidentally taken my clonazepam AND d-amphetamine together two days in a row like a big fucking idiot with amazing brain fog. 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE check your generics when you get them. The shortages are causing pharmacists to go to other manufacturers to try and keep your medications in stock. I am grateful mine has been able to keep EVERYTHING in stock, though my inhalers are name brand since that's all they could get in.

TL;DR Check your generic medications, as the shape, size, and color might have changed and might look like another pill you take. Don't make my mistake!

5,"Jeez, we still have a long way to go in layman pain med education, huh?","I am personally not on opiates and likely will never be as they do not work well for me, but my mom has severe chronic pain and was on them. She did end up addicted and lost everything abusing them and alcohol, but the pain is real and after detox and a rehab stint, she was able to take them as directed for pain relief.

Well, she got cut off because the system is broken, particularly in her state. Thankfully, her state does have a rudimentary medical marijuana program, which she was approved for. It has been night and day for her since she could use pot medicinally, especially after going a year without opiates. If she were just abusing them she wouldn't have the same pain complaints she did at month 12 as month 1 without them!

I am totally good with her using weed. I think it's great. I can't use it myself due to paradoxical reactions to it, but I believe in its medicinal benefits. I just assumed everyone close to her felt the same way.

But I just learned, they don't. Her sister, my aunt, shocked the hell out of me by ""secretly"" telling me that she takes edibles, thinking I'd be appalled. She also complained about her smoking weed. She said it was unacceptable for her to be ""stoned"". 

Uhhhhh, 'kay? So what's the alternative? Back to booze, which nearly killed her? There's no going back to opiates. She can't take NSAIDs due to other conditions. She's on a bunch of other complementary meds by her pain doc and neurologist. Everyone with chronic pain knows that tylenol is a fucking joke when it comes to pain that's beyond the pale.

My own sister and I basically just said, she doesn't work, she doesn't drive, so there's no real worry about her being compromised while stoned, and she's doing better. We support her and would say rather she use safe medical cannabis than either suffer or self-medicate. And fortunately we are moving her closer where we have way more lax pot laws and a massive variety of cannabis and CBD options, so she can dial in what works for her. I'm just still so surprised that my unconventional, generally with-it aunt was so woefully misinformed about the whole situation. 

Just made me realize we still have a long way to go to get a better broad, public understanding of pain treatment needs.

I will step off my soapbox now but dang.",

I can't really burden any one person with all of this because my descriptions are honest, but extreme. For that reason I haven't put them all down in one place before, but I need to right now.

9,Tips for Pain Relief and Weight Loss?,"My first post here so I hope I can get some advice from you guys.

My pain started 3 years ago with excruciating pain in my back to the point I couldn't walk for three days. It felt like my back was constantly spasming. My back has a low constant background pain that doesn't really bother me but when it does get sore, it essentially takes me out of action until I can lie down for an hour or so. 

There are a few things that do make it sore. Running, jumping, sitting for more than 90 minutes, standing for more than 45 minutes, lifting anything heavier than about 25kg and sitting in a chair with no back to it all seem to make it terrible and of course that's where the second part of the title comes into play because I am overweight but find it difficult to lose it because I can't really exercise.

I did go to a doctor when it first happened and they didn't even feel it, they just blamed it on my weight. When I did go back to a doctor this year, they said the most likely culprit was that some tissue/cartilage has torn and didn't repair properly so now it's permanently weakened.

So my main questions are what tips do you have to help the pain when it does flare up and what tips do you guys have for helping weight loss?",
10,"I wanna die,please :( (Life-Story+Rant)","Here is my story how rare disease is ""choking""  me alive.... oh and of course after that is my ranting and bitching about my current life

**Hello let me explain my situtation to u dear wariors:**

**I am 18 yrs old,past 3 years dealing with still not officialy diagnosed illness,**it was managable first 2years ,bloating,distention,nausea,fatigue ,weak and loud joints ,ok i could still live, not like healthy person but i could work,enjoy movies or video games,get enough sleep and rest even that my body was already giving me signs on daily basis that something is  wrong . Things got a lot worse this year,i started getting a lot more constipated, getting more bloated and distented,fatigue became pretty bad,anxiety and depression start kicking in ,but i could still get some relief...

Got some Xans from my psych...,it helps with anxiety a lot but my gut symptoms were worse and worse.Than at the start of april from day to day i felt sicker,stomach started getting lower and became bloated 24/7,horrible body fatigue and anxiety,having problems with BM even with laxativesno apetite,,tried low FODMAP for few weeks,no relief,lost 30 pounds in a month,dropped out of high school because i couldn't function anymore. At May 2018 my GP sent me to hospital when i stayed for week and they done some bunch of tests(Endoscopy,CT of abdomen,Ultrasound,stool and blood tests....,RTG of abdomen ,...) Docs already thought it's in my ""head"" when i showed them my distented gut,ohh it's normall because you are thin bla bla bla.... After that they found nothing wrong with me besides my depression and anxiety and referred me to psych. ward. I was so fucking angry and devastated in the same time,even my dad which kind of believed me that i have physical source of my gut issues started to think its mostly in my head. I refused to go to psych.ward. 

Got home felt like shit (still better right now ).Started to think about suicide but i told myself no i won't give in without  answers..... Started drinking not anything crazy about a glass of wine per day... Not much of stomach relief but at least something u know..... Could sit in weird position and at least let my mind getting involved in something else than reality,it worked  a little bit if i ate nothing during day i could get some relief in my symptoms... After i visited my GI doc and been told it's in my head i  willingly did go to psych. ward to do some steps forward because i though if iam going to prove them it's not mental it could help and i could do tests which left. I wanted diagnostic laparoscopy i contacted few surgeons and asked what do i need for this diagnostic surgery etc...  After 4 weeks in psych. ward i sign in reverse and left. Parents weren't happy but i got vision in my mind so i ignored them.... I made appoinment with surgeon told him my story. I took my whole medical records (Including CT scan) with me and  once he oppened CT scan he spotted that my transverse colon is elongated deep into the pelvic area and that i could order for surgery...  

It gives me hope and i thought ok,it make a sense why iam having all this issues,but when i searched on net o couldn't find that it could cause so much trouble and severe symptoms which i was experiencing ,but still i believed that's my problem and that after surgery i will live happy and healthy life again after past months of hopelesness...

&amp;#x200B;

Hell yeah it didn't happen,few days after surgery i was experiencing same symptoms and haven't got much relieve i was little bit less bloated but everything else was the same. Nausea,fatigue,constant pressure and distention of my lower abdomen,bladder problems etc.... When i told them that iam experiencing same symptoms they of course started being sceptic about my sittuation ...

Next day surgeon told me that my sigmoid part of colon is elongated too but it shouldn't do any problems besides of constipation... Of course  again believed ok that's why iam feeling like this .... I started googling everything and started asking myself because it seems unreal that elongated sigmoid could do such tortue to me... I swallowed it up and believed that root of my issues is elongated colon.I wast told again by family that iam crazy that i wanted another surgery. But i haven't listened to them i wanted to be healthy so much that i asked surgeon if i can get to another surgery as soon as possible and it worked .

I haven't heard of visceroptosis or gastroptosis then.

&amp;#x200B;

So after second surgery when i woke up i couldn't tell if it solved my issues(narcotics....) ,but after few days when i started drinking water i became devastated and couldn't understand why iam experiencing same symptoms again,my lower abdomen became distented and bloated really bad even while drinking tea or water... 

Of course i told this to my surgeon and other docs at hospital but they said ,there is nothing wrong with u on physical level and of course they told me it's in your head.... I started asking  a lot of question about whole operation surgeon told me he could send me pics..  I started feeling really hopeless and just couldn't accept that it's in my head when i could feel every second of my existence that something is not alright with my body.Jesus when i started eating after second surgery hell it's even worse than before like after i ate something my lower abdomen became like rocks,urination became more difficulty.

All tests including past surgeries laparoscopic resection of my elongated transverse and sigmoid colon has giving me more misery than answers or solution.

I started searching for possible diagnosis,or other tests left,then i somehow got into pictures of distented gut on google and i saw a lightweight women on picture when on the left side:  she wear band all over her abdomen and on the right side i could clearly see distented lower abdomen which looked just like mine after i developed symptoms... 

Up in the corner was the title: **Visceroptosis/Gastroptosis ,**i opened webpage where was a lot more information about this condition + few old stories mostly of women of how it destroyed their overall wellness.... Every single thing matches perfectly with my symptoms but there was only or two recent medical records of this condition shared on internet . There was only older like from 20-19th century books and medical records i could find and i read them all including possible treatment and relief methods.But current medicine has no remedy or cure for it. I wasn't happy to find out that i may be screwed totally for life witho no cure .

It's constant hell, i could live or manage pain at least with opiods,but can't do anything with displacement or relaxation of vicera or at least i don't know anything that could help to  uphold my internal organs to such degree that i can function somehow :(. 

**Now b\*tching/crying/venting:**

DOcs think i am just hypochondriac ,i have every symptom of visceroptosis (abdominal organs prolapsing into my pelivs),can't prove anything now  and it doesnt really matter , iam disabled,fatigued all day,can't walk or stand for longer than few seconds without feeling like iam going to pass out,cant pee without my assistence of squeezing bladder,sleep- that's not existing anymore if i ate anything during that day ,can't poop without asistance of my fingers (it's gross but that's me right now ),even my mind is not working like i can't focus on fucking movie or play stupid video game,iam bedridden most of the time and on ""paper "" i am healthy. WTF?!  I started buying and hiding my alcohol consuption past week ,i faking hate it ,its going to do more harm but that's only thng which helps me fall asleep or ease my sufffering and numb me. 

I know it's not going to help in long-term but i don't even want to ,i just want to have peace ,what is point of suffering where you can't win ? You know it can't be cured and u are and will be slave to it into end of your life.

I was intersted into Yoga i read before bunch of thinks like how we create suffering or that it's possible to live or meditate even wih chronic pain and broken bodies but i am not able to do that,i can't concentrate even on that stupid book or music sometimes its worsening everything :(

&amp;#x200B;

I hate waking up these dreams where iam alive,it's so devastating...

There is this slight thing inside me ,wanting to prove at least that it's not all in my head, and show it to the world that iam not hypochondriac and that this not psychosomatic shit but it's real and it's cruel.

I could get temporary relief in some upwards body positions ,but it's very slight

I'm following a taper on/off schedule for psych meds right now (off Topomax and Zoloft), and starting a new medication (on Wellbutrin), so I'm expecting lots of side effects. To be honest, my psychiatrist didn't recommend any taper schedule, but I wasn't comfortable switching the way she recommended so I am tapering instead. 

BUT... I have an appointment with my primary doc and rheumatologist coming up later this month. I wanted to talk about switching up my pain med, because it's stopped being effective months ago and I've just been putting up with it. 

I am thinking about rescheduling these appointments (at least the rheumatologist) until the side effects from the psych meds wears off, but I was wondering if anyone else had any experiences with this? ",

16,99% sure of the source of my pain,"Dear fellow pain sufferers,

I am writing to let you know about my story. I have been perplexed, hopeless, fatigued beyond anything I've ever felt, and suffering the most pain I have ever endured in my life for over 3 years.

Because my pain had gotten so bad I was bedridden most days, I decided time to move to a country like Portugal so that I could get adequate pain relief and not have the attached feelings of being treated like an addict/criminal as I have for the years enduring this, and after reading the horror stories of what you go through. 

I have been a 20 year user of benzodiazepines  prescribed for sleep and anxiety. My pain started when I developed tolerance withdrawal. Then after getting a new psych doctor, and explaining my frequent panic attacks, I was switched from .5 mg lorazepam to .5 clonazepam 3/x day, including my 30 mg for temezepam for sleep. I then began a further journey into a whole new layer of hell. The pain got worse. I have spent years, seen dozen of doctors, had procedures that either didn't work or made me worse, and given off label medication for pain which I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy (Cymbalta). During this time I went through a forced withdrawal which almost killed me and probably caused permanent damage. 

I went through a self taper with no medical supervision or guidance because I was afraid that someone or somehow I would have to go through that hell again and my anxiety and insomnia was getting worse. I have been free from benzos for about 2 months, maybe. My memory is not great. About a week ago, I noticed the severe pain and fatigue were lifting. Then my memories returned. Then I began to suspect all this pain was actually from clonazepam. THEN I began to read the horror stories and find so many others like me, living in benzo hell and trying to get a life back. 

I am having memories return, and do not sleep but every 2-3 days. When I wake up, I never know how I'll feel. I don't know who I am, what I like, where my friends are, my husband, my career, my family. I have been abandoned by nearly everyone and given a death sentence by my own doctor.  I am and have been extremely angry since Friday, and just want to say that the real killer are not opioids, but benzodiazepines. I was on a medication for years that is the top 3 killer in the US. I WAS NEVER WARNED, and NOT A SINGLE DOCTOR ever linked my symptoms to my prescription. 

I am very depressed waking up to the disaster my life has become. I am lonely because I do not find any family understanding at all. I have no one nearby I can talk to because I did not abuse this medication, or any others, or use drugs. So I don't have a real community that I can find support. I just wanted to mention my story because maybe one of you are prescribed benzos, or a loved one. PLEASE PLEASE do your research, and get support. Doctors are killing people needlessly and even though these drugs have been around for 40 years, no one is taking them seriously enough. I may have had extreme results from side effects, but I really believed they were helping, and to find out how much they destroyed my body, my mind, and everything I worked hard to earn, well, I am livid beyond belief. So, I'm going to be focusing on my recovery, as it may take up to 2 years, or maybe as long as 6 if I even can regain full mental and physical abilities. I do know this, I feel emotions again, and hardly any pain, and no longer need glasses. I am glad to be feeling something other than pain. Best wishes. Thank you for your support. This is a great sub.",
17,A complete nightmare.,"Started with a herniated disc and progressed to stenosis I guess. Nerve pain and all that. My doctor told me a few weeks ago ""No one can fix your problem."" Surgery is apparently an option but it's not a road he wants to go down right now because according to him it could make things worse. Next step is injections I guess. Tried to go back to work and do light duty but I couldn't even do that as I work in a factory and ""light duty"" is still hellish. Finally asked to be put on medical leave. Finances aren't great due to only 1 income right now, pain medication (currently taking Robaxin, Gabapentin and Ibuprofen) is pretty much a joke at this point. All it does is enable me to sleep which is the only real relief I get and even that is brief. Started physical therapy but I'm not super optimistic about it. My insurance sucks so things are about to start getting really expensive. Worried I'm not gonna be able to return to my job at the end of the 12 week medical leave. Which is a shame because I'm good at my job and I have made a lot of friends there that I'll miss terribly... the job itself sucks but I do the best I can with what it is. This is on top of being diagnosed with PCOS and PTSD this year. Guess you could say 2018 hasn't been kind to me. Worried that if I can't work we won't be able to pay our bills. Just a lot of stress on top of pain that really won't relent. I'm 26. I never thought I'd be dealing with this at my age. I guess pain doesn't care how old you are or how inconvenient it is for you. Sorry to bitch... just weighing heavily lately and I dont like to weigh my family down with it all the time.  ",
18,Has anyone had experience of converting from Fentanyl transdermal patches to oral morphine tablets?,"My wife has been on 200mcg/hr patches for approx 14 years. I have been trying to get her medical people to reduce this dosage for years now as I believe that the medication is probably the source of most of her problems. 
Finally a pain specialist seems to agree and has recommended that she be switched from the Fentanyl TDP to oral morphine tablets. While I am happy that the pain specialist is competent, I have zero confidence in my wifes doctors being able to prescribe and support her in this switch. Indeed, it seems that they are just going to prescribe a massive (calculated) dose of morphine tablets to her and let us get on with it at home unsupervised.   
I have been reading up on conversions from one opioid to another and it seems that in the case of Fentanyl TDP conversion to morphine tablets, that a long period of time, one to three days be given between removing the patch and administering the full dose of morphine. In between times there should be an oral ""rescue dose"" of possibly liquid morphine to handle bouts of pain which this might cause.  No-one has mentioned this up till now and the rescue medication hasn't been prescribed.
I am very worried that she might possibly die in front of me because I do not know what to watch out for. But it is either this or watch her slowly turn into a zombie and die from the amount of medication she is on right now anyway. Her last ten years have been a complete waste.",
19,Why your doctor has weaned you or stopped prescribing you opioids for chronic pain,"As a seasoned physician and prescriber of opioids for chronic pain and suboxone for opioid use disorder, I would like to, for the record, state that no ""...person or authority has told physicians that opioids aren't needed for pain relief..."". I have been involved in the world of chronic pain management with the use of opioids for 2 decades and I consider myself to be well-informed on current medical literature, laws, trends and practices across the nation, both at the state and federal level. Please let me assure you that there is no state or federal entity that I have encountered that is telling me that I cannot prescribe opioids for chronic pain FULL STOP! If that were the case there would likely be a revolt upon governing bodies that transcends opioid prescribing and delves into the topic of restrictions being put upon a license that I spent 12 long years of my life to earn. But that's a whole different issue.

Your are absolutely correct in saying that YES! I absolutely am concerned about protecting my state medical license as well as my federal DEA license, the very license that affords me the privilege of safely and responsibly prescribing opioids to those who desperately require them for both pain relief and maintenance of quality of life.

I can assure you that the decisions being made on the front lines of primary care offices nation wide have more to do with fear and hassle factor than any proscriptive mandate from state or federal authorities. As physician, we are trained to ""first do no harm"", which is a tenet I practice by everyday when treating my patients. I balance the benefits and the risks of any proposed intervention whether it is pharmacotherapy or surgery and through a process of shared decision making, arrive at an intervention that is acceptable to both me and my patient as well as in keeping with what is known as evidence-based medicine. Occasionally, as physicians, we even try things that are known to be effective for a select population that have not been proven to be evidence-based medicine. Those are more exceptions than the rule but clinical judgment and years of experience permit me the discretion to use medications and other modalities as ""off label"", in the hopes that it will provide a modicum of relief or improve the life of a patient.

I do not practice medicine out of fear no more than I ascribe to some politician's partisan idea of what's best for my patients. I practice medicine using the full gambit of what is available to me, which includes my training, my medical fund of knowledge, my life experiences and my patients' input and the powers vested in me by my governing board of medicine. Having said that, I alone choose whether I want to continue to prescribe opioids to my patients who require them. Doctors who are rapidly tapering opioids or electing to stop prescribing them are doing it because they chose to do this NOT because they are being mandated to to do it. Yes it is true the climate of prescribing opioids has changed dramatically and gone are day the days of prescribing opioids without prescription monitoring checks and urine drug screens and pill counts and frequent visits and pain agreements and family corroboration of stories and morphine milligram equivalent calculations etc... To write a prescription opioid in today's climate is to agree, as a physician or PA or NP, that you will properly screen your patient and properly monitor you patient over time and that you will perform the necessary steps to achieve this so as to ensure that it is being done safely and responsibly and that the pills you prescribe are indicated, continue to be indicated and are at the lowest effective dose possible all the while ensuring that they are going into the mouths of the patients you are prescribing to. All of this takes time and resources and effort and accountability and YES it does involve risk and liability and research and vigilance and documentation and again, most of all.....TIME!

Time is valuable and time is limited in the field of medicine and time is not something that doctors have a lot of in daily practice. It takes me on average, 40 to 50 minutes to properly, safely, responsibly and adequately evaluate and treat my chronic pain patients on opioid therapy in order to comply with current position statements, laws and governing body recommendations....none of which dictates to me that I CANNOT prescribe opioids! I choose to prescribe opioids because I believe that they do help those who need them. I prescribe opioids because I CHOOSE to continue to offer this service in my practice NOT because I've been mandated not to.

I firmly believe that The CDC and the DEA and the Federation of State Medical Boards and individual state medical boards have at their heart the patients' best interest. They are simply making a public effort to address a national epidemic that we as physicians are complicit in creating and one that we are responsible for taking an active role in helping to improve. They are not attempting to take physicians out of the equation or restrict their licenses so as not to be able to meet the needs of their patients' pain needs. Rather they are laying the ground work for safe and responsible prescribing of what are very serious and potentially dangerous drugs in the wrong hands. I applaud their work and I work within the confines of their rules, which is NOT to get me to STOP prescribing but rather to approach my prescribing in accordance with the current times that warrant such action.

So please do NOT blame your senators or your congressman or your state legislators for taking away you opioids, blame your own doctor! Ask him directly what it is about the current climate that forced him to make the decision to stop prescribing opioids and if he/she is upfront and honest, you will likely hear that the process of vetting and screening and maintaining opioids has become onerous and that he and his staff cannot physically and mentally keep up the pace or that they cannot provide the necessary structure to do it safely. And you can blame the government for enacting these new position statements and laws of tighter regulation but it is for the safety of the general public (my patients) and is NOT intended to make physicians or PA's or NP's stop prescribing. It just happens to be the law of unintended consequences.

The light at the end of the tunnel will be the development of opioids that are effective mitigators of pain without the risk of tolerance or addiction in taking them. I believe the person or persons who invent that should automatically be awarded the Nobel prize in science.",
20,What would you say to a newbie?,"I'm pretty new to this chronic pain thing. I don't actually have a diagnosis for the cause yet; doctors are still arguing and referring me. In the meantime, however, I have pain in my neck, head, back, hips, bla bla, and its affecting my work and social life.

21,Sitting in Urgent Care right now....,"Have been in pain since Wednesday night and I finally went in for the pain. Not sure why I was given a red bracelet saying NKDA. They think I stained my sciatica so I got a shot of Toradahl and 5mg of Valium. Now my bad leg feels deader than normal.

Update: I was sent home with a script for steroids and a different muscle relaxer that is honestly AMAZEBALLS hence why I'm updating nearly 12 hours later. 😉  Actually the steroids and leftover valium in my system in conjunction with little to no sleep in 3 days caused me to nap on and off until close 23:30 CST when I was startled awake. I took the muscle relaxer then and had some restless rest for 2 hours.

I'm still very sore on the same areas I went in with but I went from a pain level of SUPER HIGH 9 down a High 7 and that is in flux. I'm just so happy they treated me decently when I went in and not like a criminal. ",8

49,In So Much Pain. Doctors Are Stumped.,"Not seeking medical advice...just ranting or wanting insight to an extent. Just see if others experience what I do. 
I’m a 19, soon to be 20 year old woman. This pain started last year on and off, came back this March with a vengeance. It’s been nonstop pain since March. 
It’s mostly my leg. The pain switches up often. Started in my left calf–aching, burning, throbbing. Went to see a doctor. He said he didn’t know, told me to come back in two weeks. I did. He said maybe it’s nerve pain, put me on amitriptyline. Didn’t do anything, came back. He shrugged his shoulders and said “well if it hurts in the next few weeks, come back.” 
Went to another doctor. She didn’t know and startling googling my symptoms. She just ended up saying “that’s weird” and sent me on my merry way. Couldn’t help but cry after I left because I was in immense pain with no answers. 
A friend eventually convinced me to go to a hospital. The doctor there said “that’s weird,” but decided he’d get me to get an ultrasound for blood clots. I got the ultrasound, no clots. 
The pain is spreading and worsening too. I feel it in both legs now, my left arm, pain in my chest. It keeps me up at night. It’s 5 am and I haven’t slept. I can’t. Too much pain. The pain is now like a bubbling feeling under my skin, along with burning, extreme sensitivity, (can’t have anything touch my upper leg at the moment...any pain intensifies the pain tenfold and I can’t help but make a pained noise. I want to cry and I’m not one to cry from pain.) and then randomly, every few minutes or so, sharp stabbing pains in the affected area.
I don’t know what to do. I just want the pain to stop. ",
50,Has anyone used a power-assisted manual wheelchair?,"I posted recently about some issues with my education degree program and my chronic pain. This is kind of an update to that, but with an additional question. 

 I have gotten to the point that my cane and walker don't really help enough for the things I need to do. I was worried about failing my degree because I'm having trouble keeping up with my clinicals (placement in the school, working with a class all day long at least once a week) on top of all the other day to day things I have to do (like classes at my university, running errands, leaving the house at all for any reason, etc). I spoke with disability services at my school and I meet with voc rehab tomorrow, but here's where I'm at:

The disability services officer asked about my current mobility aids and my needs. I really need to be sitting for most of the day, and walking all over the school is hell. I don't have the energy or pain tolerance for much else, so I tend to stay in the classroom even when the class leaves to go do other things (which is not okay with my degree supervisor). She suggested I look into a mobility scooter, since a manual wheelchair would be too tiring and a fully electric wheelchair is a bit excessive. 

I have many concerns about a scooter, partly because of the logistics of getting it in and out of the car/lift, bringing it inside every day to keep it from getting stolen or damaged, and also partly because of the stigma. I'm heavy, despite my best efforts, and heavy people in scooters is a cliche I just can't live with. 

However, I think there may be a happy medium. I've seen power-assisted wheelchairs here and there online, but I really wasn't sure about them and I never had the money. If voc rehab is footing the bill, it might be an option. Has anyone used something like this before? Is there a type you'd recommend? Should I may look at other options? I really need something like this in order to finish my last year of school and to have any chance at teaching in a regular school instead of online classes or something. ",

55,Constant nausea... it never goes away,"I've had nausea constantly the past... maybe... 4/5 years? before that I must admit i was more nauseous than your average person, I've had a diagnosis of IBS since about 8. Since my ""breakdown"" and the start of the nausea, doctors have simply slapped me with a confirmation that I was diagnosed with anxiety the year before, and, after losing over half of my weight in little over 4 months, to the point where i was skin and bones, I was diagnosed with Autism. They then proceeded to pat themselves on the back for a job well done, and p*ssed off without meerly a solution as to WHY I'm feeling this asides from the subcontext of ""oh, maybe it's all in your head"". Once I turned 18 (20 now), which was literally a WEEK after the reality crumbling diagnosis of autism (ya know, realising this whole time there was something mentally different that effects my entire social skills and personal development is a bit of a shocker), it was entirely up to me to orchestrate my support. I've had a camera down my throat and they found nothing. my latest psychologist said that my anxiety causes breathing irregularities which then builds up carbon dioxide around the muscles outside my stomach causing them to contract and jiggle my stomach around = nausea. so I'm to try breathing exercises. I tried Cyclizine, and that REALLY didn't work. I drink gaviscon from the bottle and bulk buy chewing gum. I try to of course heavily regulate my usage of these things, I only have gaviscon 3 times a day at most to correct dosages, and only have about 2-3 sticks of gum if i'm going through a tough stage with my nausea. I'm strict with my medicine taking as you can tell. I tried CBD ONCE, and I think my anxiety at the ""holy crap you're taking something that is technically part of an illegal narcotic and you barely even drink"" thing kicked my nausea into the ground. But, after I calm down a bit, I think I'll maybe try CBD again.
The real kicker about this though, is that since the start of this, i've suddenly been unable mentally to travel. If I feel sick and someone tries to force me into travelling, my body will do anything in it's power to avoid it. meltdowns galore. I've barely left my sh*tty wee town in over 5 years, and being stuck in this place in scotland forever?... oof. I'd rather not go into it.

TL;DR: My nausea's been going on for years, docs seem to think it's all in my head, idk if it is, tried all sorts doesn't really work v well. Can't travel or leave my room in general v well because of it. 

Anyone else got this? Any ideas? If it's something really bad you think it might be that requires a hospital check - don't tell me. I can't travel to get my breasts checked (and the docs are unwilling to sedate or knock me out to take me to the hospital to check despite my explicit consent). If it's something dangerous, I'm just gonna have to... idk... die from it lmao.",

Due to my contract with my pain management, I am aware that I am not allowed to be prescribed opiates/narcotics by anyone other than my pain dr.

My question is, how do I go about getting my meds for post-op? Do I tell my pain management and they prescribe it? Or do they authorize my surgeon to prescribe it? 

Any help would be appreciated, as the idea of bringing this up to my pain management dr makes me very anxious.

Thank you in advance. ",
59,Symptoms relapsed ...now what?,"Or, I should say, in remission. Hi, as some of you know, I have had severe chronic pain for over 3 years. I have had about (3) 5 day, and a couple week periods of no pain. It was so bad I had to quit PT. My pain seemed to shift from my muscles, to the joints, then along the outside of my limbs. When I felt it shifting, I began a forced regimen of working out. 

I noticed that when I was 1. Dancing or 2. Gambling, the pain didn't control me. So I kept moving, in spite of the pain, and it got better. Keep in mind I have been a decades long user of benzos for anxiety and sleep issues, and had recently decided to come off them about 2 months ago.  Getting off the benzos has been the best decision by far. I notice things smell great, music is enjoyable again, and I enjoy being alive far more than I can remember. I took less than the prescribed dose, and didn't abuse, so I'm really in shock that their affect, while quick at reducing anxiety, had driven emotional response from my system. I wonder if they somehow caused my pain?

So 3 years of not being able to work, not having a SO, and mounting bills due to a gambling habit that was my only source of relief, I am picking up the pieces. I really need a job. I have so many bills to get caught up with. I have isolated myself due to pani/anxiety to the point where I have no one to do fun things with anymore (especially now when I am ready) 3. I don't have much in common with people who do not work. I want out of this hell of isolation and hopelessness.

I have updated my resume and got interest, so I am cautiously going to have a chat with a local principal next week. I have my anxiety under control (Day 2), and while part of me really wants to try, the other part is afraid that if/when the pain comes back, I will be let go again. The last time that happened was December. I had a very part time job in the meantime, and they let me go in May. Those 2 experiences were soul crushing, as I had not been let go of a job before for not being able to be there. I don't handle rejection well, and this area has so many sour memories that I would rather move. 

Selling my house has been extremely difficult, as 2 sales did not go through in the past 3 years. I had difficulty with showings due to the need to get the house clean and be gone during times of extreme pain/fatigue. 

I need advice. I do not have a counselor now. If I stay here any longer, I really need to work. But if my pain is truly gone, it would be a great time to move. I have no boyfriend/husband here anymore, and due to not working, hardly any friends. I have much higher ambitions than working for pennies, for very long hours, but it will keep me out of the casino and provide income and supplemental insurance. 

What would you do?",
60,I’m Devastated,"So I went to see my PT today as we’ve been on a once a week appointment over the last three months.

So anyway. I went in, business as usual. And she told me that her last day is this Friday, and she’s moving on to a different job. I’m happy for her as it will be a move toward her goals in life etc. over the last couple years that I’ve been working with her, I’ve gotten to know her on a more personal level. 

But, as for keeping my SIJD and all the side issues that come with it in check, she was my best treatment. Without her I don’t know how I’ll manage things when I get another flare up. I’ve told a couple people, and they’re like: well she gave you a recommendation for another therapist, just go see them. And I’m sure the other therapist is great. But I trusted my PT so much.

61,An intro to me,"Hello, I am a young lady of almost 24 years. When I was 19 years old I had a janitor job and started having a lot of shoulder pain, which I supposed was from having almost zero physical activity to lifting lots of heavy trash. It would wake me up in the middle of the night, it was extremely severe and seriously affected my sleep schedule. I tried sleeping on different platforms, ibuprofen didnt help. I do feel like i should also mention that i am an avid tosser of satans salad, if you catch my drift. Anyway, the pain lessened as years went by, but it seems to be coming back. It isnt waking me up as much, but it does sometimes. Regardless whenever i do wake up it just hurts in my shoulders, like a sharp ache (if that makes any sense.) On a scale of one to ten, this pain is about an 8. I imagine this is happening again because im probably sleeping on my shoulder wrong, but I dont know how to prevent myself from doing something when I'm not conscious to know im doing it. 

Aside from that, my knees KILL me whenever I'm bent down for too long (i.e. scooping the litter box.) On a scale of one to ten, it is a ten.

I'm literally vomiting because the pain is so bad, but I fought myself for calling in, because I'm afraid of how it will look due to an extended (2 week absence) from work over a month ago that I took because of a bad secondary infection that I got. 


I try to remind myself that a) my boss has always been really understanding, b) I have no choice but to call in because I'm shaking with pain and I almost passed out in the bathroom, c) it's very uncommon to fire someone where I work and that I've never been written up, and d) there is another worker there that is there the whole time that I am and can keep the pressure off of my supervisors. 


That being said, I'm still freaking myself out waiting for her reply (like I always do when I'm forced to call in), worrying about the worst that could happen and even mentally berating myself for not forcing myself to go into work when I am past my tolerable threshold for pain. 


Update: I heard back from her and she doesn't seem too pleased with me, but that may just be my perception.

So, I suffer from severe chronic pain due to Endometriosis, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, and possibly Fibromyalgia. I had been taking 10/325mg Oxycodone AND a 25mg Fentanyl Patch along with Methocarbomol and Gabapentin, but after several months of having my pain under control, my doctor allowed me to lower the Fentanyl dosage to 12mg and I was so happy. This summer, I was super productive, working and taking two difficult intensive classes in 8 weeks. 


However, by the time Fall semester started my pain skyrocketed. I can hardly sleep it's so bad. And it's everywhere so there's no getting comfortable. So, I'm basically permanently exhausted. I'm on campus five days a week, eight hours a day, between work and class. Sitting all that time absolutely kills me, but there's no alternative. 


I don't want to increase my Fentanyl dosage again and I don't want Cymbalta because of a reaction that I had to a drug in the same class. I don't want more pain pills because I'm not sure that will do the trick. I can't seem to fit physical therapy into my schedule and I almost overdosed on ibuprofen the other day by complete accident because I was so desperate for some relief. I miss my hot showers, but even between patches, I can't take one hot enough to relax my muscles because then I run the risk of passing out because of my low blood pressure. 


I'm also stressed out because I have to get my wisdom teeth out and anesthesia (local and otherwise) doesn't always work on people with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. I'm terrified of having to feel it and hear it on top of my existing Hell. 


My schoolwork is suffering unless I force myself to suffer instead and I just am struggling to remember why I'm in school and trying in the first place. 


Everything seems to take so much effort, from hanging up my clothes in my closet (we moved in in July, FYI) to just getting dressed and out the door in the morning. I have to force myself through the day and then all I want to do is sleep the whole time. 


It's made so much worse by the fact that I was doing so good and my pain was still awful but not constant agony, and now I feel like that's been taken from me. I'm only 24, I don't want to go back to the worst of it where I can't function at all and I have to spend 18+ hours a day in bed. I'm worried that this is just the beginning and that when I transfer to a 4 year school it will be even worse. That me feeling better was a fluke, just to tease me with what my life could have been. 


Right now, I just kind of hate my life.

76,It was supposed to start getting better!,"One year ago I finally found a doctor that listened to me about my back pain. I though, finally, I was going to start getting better.  Now a little over a year later, 4 MRIs, 1 myelogram, 33 injections (including the test injections for the RFA) and an L3-S1 RFA on the right and my back is worse than it was before. My herniation used to only be visible on a seated, flexion/extension MRI. Got the results of a new Supine MRI today and the herniation is clearly visible and there is clear nerve impingement. WTF!

80,My quality of life,"I’ve had migraines as long as I can remember. No one ever believed me. They became worse at puberty. Lasting 2-3 days with 1-4 days between. My doctor refused to treat me. 

They got really bad in the summer of 2016. I had a 5 day one. Then a 9 day one. 

October 3rd 2016 they became constant. 

I went to the er around week 2. They referred  me to a neuro. And were unsuccessful in aborting the migraine. 

Over the next 6 months until my neuro appointment id end up in the er every few weeks. Trying various cocktails. Some kinda helped.  None stopped the pain. 

After 3 Medicines with the neuro he said to me “I can’t help you. You will be in pain for the rest of your life” his exact words. 

These days a good day is rare. Most days I struggle to make it through work. Come home smoke enough weed and take Benadryl in hopes of sleeping through the night. I rarely do. Rarely do I get more than 45 mins in a row. 

I’m always tired. I hate that I’m like this. I wake up and tell myself I’m not gonna be in pain and it’s gonna be a good day. But it never is. Everyone around me thinks it’s in my head and I’m making it up. “There’s always something wrong with you” despite according to my manager being one of the hardest and best workers in the place.  

I work in customer service and interact with customers constantly. Sometimes I get aphasia so bad I’m nearly crying because i can’t get the words out. 

I rarely do things I actually enjoy anymore. Since being diagnosed with ocular migraines and cluster headaches I’ve became so depressed. I’m not suicidal in the sense id act on it. But I genuinely don’t wanna be alive if it means being in this much pain all the time. I bust my ass off way more than anyone else I know and they aren’t in this much pain. 

Most of my paycheck is spent on weed as idk how I’d survive without it. It makes me not care about the pain. 

One of my best friends is getting married next year and I’m in the wedding.  I’m afraid of being in pain that day. 

I’m into tattoos and body mods and I am getting my tongue split on Sunday at a tattoo convention. I’m more worried about the noise than I am the actual splitting. 

I just want my life back. I’m not even 21 yet.

82,"Herniated Disc L4-L5 [UPDATE]-Dull, heavy, low back ache","Hi guys, I posted about a month ago describing the low back pain I've been having for the past year almost. The original post is here [https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/9752df/herniated\_disc\_l4l5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/9752df/herniated_disc_l4l5/)

But just a super quick summary: I am a 6-2 170lb 20yo male college student. Crippling back pain for past ten months, MRI determined it was from L4-L5 herniated disc. Much more detailed in original post \^

I wanted to give an update. Since that post, I have gotten another injection called a nerve root block. I have been doing core exercises and yoga every day, with constant bed rest due to persisting pain. Yet the pain has changed to a more dull, heavy, low back ache. Most of the day, I don't feel any of the sharp or really bad pains in my back as I was feeling before. But this is no better as it the pain still exists, it has just changed form. To clarify, I am in pain 24/7 and it is often hard to stand for more than a minute at a time, and sitting though class has been difficult.

However, earlier this week, I said fuck it, because I've been sick and tired of laying in bed in my dorm all day every day, went to the rec center, sucked up the pain, and did about a 15 min run on the treadmill. As opposed to my pain before, as described in my last post, where nearly any exercise would worsen my pain, and disable me for the next week, now I simply feel no change in the pain level. Just the constant dull and heavy ache, as if there is a constant pressure encompassing my low back. It has been incredibly frustrating.

This development in the pain is better I guess, but really not much. I constantly have to lie down, and it has ruined my college experience so far. It's just so weird that I felt the same during my 15 minutes on the treadmill as my sitting down for an hour in class. Yet no matter what position I am in, I still am put in extreme discomfort by the ache in my low back that seems to literally weigh me down.

I detailed in my last post, if you've read this far without reading the original post, about all the doctors and treatment I've had. I have another appointment with an orthopedic doc set up next week and I will most certainly ask about the change in pain. I just wanted to post again because last time I did this I got several helpful suggestions which I appreciated. So, once again, if anyone has had a similar situation, or can shed some light on mine, it would be greatly appreciated.

Final update on all of the treatment I have done (nearly all of which were ineffective, if not very short term solutions):

Over the counter pain meds, prescription pain meds, lidocaine patches, TENS unit, ice, heat, chiropractor, physical therapy, yoga, McKenzie stretches, orthopedic surgeon, MRI/X-Ray, cortisone shot, oral steroids, epidural injection, nerve root block injection.

About the only abnormal thing is I have some minor scoliosis which my doctor reckons most people have a little bit and is enough to cause ""some minor pain."" He also reckons the bulging discs aren't enough to cause pain even though it's been hurting for over a decade.

My brain mri is great, all of the bloods I've ever had done are totally normal, my ovaries are fine. So nfi why I have constant headaches without medication, my back hurts all of the time and limits what I'm able to do, my uterus fucking kills me whenever it feels like it, I get fatigued really easily (especially over winter) and I haven't even bothered to look into all of the other random spontaneous pains because inflammation markers are normal.

I just want something to come up wrong, I want an actual problem that I can fix. I want to be able to tell people that I have a diagnosis and not have them blame ME for being in pain and tired all the time. I AM taking care of my body, it's just not taking care of me.

89,I just feel sad about the things I'm missing out on sometimes.,"I'm not looking for answers, I guess just letting it out.

I'm 4.5 months pregnant with chronic (currently daily) migraines and TMJD and am unfortunately one of the few who has worsening migraines during pregnancy.

It's one of my favorite times of year, the very first bit of fall, and I just feel a little sad about all the stuff I haven't done because I can't without great suffering. I love to do nature walks but even my usual easy to moderate ones have flared me up this summer. I couldn't keep a garden alive because after work I just had to crawl into bed, and on the weekends I am too tired to weed or water. I was too tired to keep my hummingbird feeders filled so my normal flock of hummingbirds is absent. I love to can and I haven't canned hardly anything yet. I won't be getting any fall chicks this year to raise for eggs.

It's okay, I'm very grateful to be growing a human and to have a decent job with insurance, and there is some hope for my migraines as I see a specialist soon. I just miss the little things I could do even during the really bad weeks that made life nicer. I hope next year I can do them again (at least as much as one can with a newborn!).",

96,Chronic Ankle Pain,"So I am new here, but I figured this would be the best place to get advice or just talk about my issues.  So in 2016, I broke my ankle, and it was a severe break.  Luckily it wasnt a compound fracture, but the ER doctors said it was very close to becoming one.  I had surgery a couple of days later, which involved a metal plate and 7 screws along with a tight rope because every ligament and tendon in my ankle was torn.  

&amp;#x200B;

A week after the surgery, I developed a staph infection in my ankle bones, and had another surgery to clean out the infection and replace all of the metal in my ankle, with fresh metal.  I was in the hospital for a week, and received a PIC line for 6 weeks.  I couldnt start physical therapy for 5 months or so, and my ankle was so tight and weak, it was bad.  I did my best in PT, and stopped around 3 months later.  

&amp;#x200B;

Ive had constant pain and tightness in my ankle since the break, and I just had another surgery by one of the top ankle surgeons in the world.    The arthroscopy surgery cleaned out severe scar tissue along with grinding down 3 bone spurs.  I have had severe pain since the surgery, but I am pushing myself, which means Im walking on it and trying my best to move it so I wont develop so much scar tissue again.  I am afraid that this surgery wont fix my pain, and I am worried that no one will do anything for my pain.  With the way narcotic pain medications are seen by the public and doctors, I am worried that nothing will be done if my pain continues, and I cant keep having so much pain, I am starting to become down on myself because I cant play with my daughter like I want, I cant go out with friends, and I just stay inside more than anything now because I always hurt.  

&amp;#x200B;

I really hope this surgery will fix my issues, but I have little hope and the doctor isnt sure how my ankle will respond since Ive had so many issues with it.  Im not sure what to do, the doctor said I shouldn't have so much pain right now since it was only two small incisions, but he does seem to think since Ive had so many issues, it will take longer to heal.  The issue Im facing right now, is that I will be out of medication for pain in 1 day or so, and the last time this happened I was crying because I hurt so bad.  The doctor will only give me enough medication for 3 days or so, and when I run out, they require me to come in to see them.

&amp;#x200B;

I just dont know what to do, Im in a ton of pain, and I feel like I have no options left.  Ive had three angle surgery's now and I just hurt all of the time, and I hate it, I hate the fact that I have a low quality of life and I am open to suggestions on what I should do.            ",

98,Learning to Change my Mindset,"I have SI Joint Dysfunction and EDS (hypermobility). I've been dealing with it for over 5 years, had lots of set backs and flare ups. This year I've really been focusing on figuring out the balance of treatments and up until three days ago I thought I had found my groove. I was mostly pain free for the first time in over a year, my pelvis wasn't shifting around constantly and I was able to run and work well. 

Now, some background: I have my BS in Exercise Science and I'm also a Licensed Massage Therapist. I spend a lot of time and energy on learning about health and wellness, keeping up to date on the trends and the current info. You know how they say doctors are the worst patients? I'm slowly learning that with my back issues the conventional guidelines for fitness and health aren't necessarily what is best for my body.

For example, the conventional positions for fitness is to train for all the types of fitness: Strength, endurance, flexibility, balance/proprioception, cardiovascular health/pulmonary health etc. Basically to be well rounded. So Typical fitness routines will include strength training, core/balance work, cardio, and flexibility work. I've always trained that way and it worked very well for me until I developed this issue.

After my last flare up which included a new issue of a bulging disc and gluteal tendon issues due to my pelvis being unstable, I stopped lifting weights and focused on a Pilates and Yoga fusion along with my running and other cardio. it helped so much that I finally thought I could get back into lifting again as I missed it. 

Last week went really well, I felt good, but sore. Then this week, I pulled my back muscle again. I think it's because my SI joint is out of alignment again. We'll see what my PT says when I see her on Wednesday. It's very mild compared to past issues, but it's still frustrating.

As I sit and reflect on things I think I need to change my mindset as far as my fitness routines. Running is important to me. So maybe it's time that I realize that I can't do it all. With my body the way it is, conventional advise doesn't work for me. All my training and research is telling me that this is wrong, but I know my body and I know what feels the best. Now it's just about getting out of my head about it and figuring out a game plan. ",SI Joint Dysfunction
99,18 year old male with Constant Headache / severe back pain,"I have pretty severe scoliosis, around 45 degrees, but I have decided not to get surgery as of now. 

I’ve done physical therapy and Pilates for my back but haven’t noticed much of a change. 

I literally always have a headache, usually it’s mild but it tends to fluctuate from severe to mild. I’ve done research and I’m starting to think it’s from tension on my neck caused by my scoliosis. Most people with scoliosis have an S curved spine, mine is more like a C. I take excedrin which used to help but not so much anymore. I tend to have 1-3 severe headaches a day and in between all that is just one never ending minor headache. This means I take 2-6 pills of excedrin a day. 

As for the back pain, I can’t sit down for more than 30 minutes without it starting to get unbearable. I am starting to do daily stretches now and hopefully it’ll help. 

I work from home and I’m self employed so I need to be able to sit in a chair for a long period of time... I just don’t know what to do anymore. I constantly feel like I need to lay down because of my back pain or headaches but then I can’t get work done. 

On top of all of this, I have ADHD (which is treated with Dexedrine) as well as anxiety and occasional panic attacks which I am not prescribed anything for. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore... I feel like my body wants me to give up on everything I’m working hard on. 

Surgery could help with pain but I’ve heard it often makes the pain even worse... I’m only 18 and I can barely handle this pain, I can’t imagine what it’s gonna feel like when I’m 30-40...

I've been waiting on seeing a physiatrist for almost a month now and in that time my back pain and nerve pain just keep getting worse no matter what I do. And recently I developed nerve pain in an area I didn't have before. I'm trying to not just stay in bed all the time but sitting is horrible and I can only stand for so long. I was referred to a  physiatrist  after getting out of the hospital. I understand that these doctors are in high demand however it seems unfair to make someone with extreme pain just wait around for a month before being given any treatments options. The nerve pain medication they gave me at the hospital and the muscle relaxer did absolutely nothing. When I told the doctor from the hospital that the medications she gave me weren't working her attitude was basically ""well that's to bad but that's why you're seeing a specialist"". Nobody fucking cares.",
101,Trouble with doctor and pain meds (NZ),"As I background, I am a 20yr female studying in uni, New Zealand. I have had two surgeries. This is for pelvic pain, which is now chronic. The first surgery (theyre laproscopies) they found a small amount of endomentriousis and ablated it (burnt it). The second surgery they found nothing and told me I don't have endomentriousis. (Confused??) Either way, I am living with this pain and am doing my best to deal with it. My toolkit is venlafaxin daily. Ibprophen and panadol for everyday pain and codiene for flare ups. The codiene is the problem.



 I saw a Gp I have seen only a few times as I was unable to get to my regular one. We caught up over my troubles from this month and I asked if I could please get a perscription for codine again as I only had a few left and like to have some on hand in case of a flare up  (this happens more often than I like and can be awful. Can't move. Can't eat. Etc.)


It was a given that she was a bit worried about this, but she was very openly suspicious and against prescribing me more codine as I was given a perscription at the start of the month. (50x 15mg). In the end she begrudgingly gave me  some 15mg in a short term supply (still below normal dose).


Problem is I normally have 2x 30mg since surgery. (March this year) I also had a 2 week long flare up resulting in me using 2 tablets three times a day. I also ended up in the hospital twice. Sometimes I had 3 tablets at a time. This is because after my surgery I was on 60 mg and my tolerance rose. I have been doing my best to bring this down and have been mildly successful.


I had been in at the beginning of the month to as I was having a bad flare up. I didn't realise it was the pain, but it was making me feel violently ill all the time. I was prescribed the codiene. This lasted around 2 weeks. I also got the flu from one of my hospital visits that left me bedridden for another week and was told by the doctor at the hospital to use codiene for the intense muscle pains. This was during the time of the flare up also.


So assuming I took 2 tablets, 3 times a day for a week- that is 42 tablets. I understand that this may seem like a lot but I am only taking what is necessary to keep me functioning and out of hospital. I was taking them for around 2 weeks.


I tried to explain to the doctor that if things were going well I would normally last over 2 months without another perscription, but it didn't seem like she was listening. This really hurts. I also wouldn't have been taking a larger quantity if they were at the dosage I normally got. But the first perscription at the beginning (from my usual doctor) was in a smaller dose so I could take a lower amount should I be able.


Do you have any advice on what I should do to repair my reputation? I am going to see my pain management team in around a week and I plan on talking to them about it as well. I feel very lost and like I'm a criminal. There's probably a mark on my record now that I am an addict or something.


 I have had someone close to me tell me I could be an addict, but I feel like it is something I can go without. It's just something that if I don't have when it is bad, I don't have another option to deal with the pain. This leads to being unable to move, eat, sleep, medicate. I can't study (I am in uni). I end up yelling and moaning and blacking out. I've had my entire body lock up and freeze. I just don't want to experience this level of pain again. I feel so alienated and awful. I just felt like this would be a place that understands how I feel. Sorry for the wall of text.",

103,Pain when sitting for prolonged time,"I'm having a pain in the ass literally, it's been 3 weeks already. I went to see a doctor a week ago and had some tests like xray on the pelvic and spine part, and blood uric acid test. It takes a few days before getting the results, so the doctor prescribed a muscle relaxant and celecoxib for the mean time. 

When the results are available, I went back on the hospital and let the doctor check the results. Everything turned normal as it seems. Since I've finished up the prescribed amount of muscle relaxant t take, she then told me that I just need to take some celecoxib when in pain again. 

So after a few days, it began hurting again. This is very unusual since I usually could sit like more than 8 hours in front of the computer working, but recently I could barely sit for a few hours then it hurts again.

I feel like the pain is not on the butthole, not on the buttcheeks, but inside near the muscle. It radiates towards my leg. Oh and the pain is on the left part of my body. I haven't gained any weight so I don't think that should be a factor. I have a gaming chair so my posture is fine. 

In order to minimize the pain, I hunch forward so that I don't put heavy weight on my butt. But that will exert some force on my lower back causing it to hurt also. 

Right now as I post this, I am lying on my back. I just took 1 tab of celecoxib just to ease the pain. Could anyone give me a second opinion on what could this pain be? I tried searching on the internet, some terms I've searched are piriformis something, that's the closest symptoms that I have. 

I hope someone would give their time and read this and hopefully give some pieces of advice. Thank you! 

Edit: Thank you so much for taking the time to discuss my condition. I highly appreciate it. I'll be having another trip to the hospital on Monday. Hopefully I'll feel much better this time.",

Nothing too bad, no surgery necessary. I healed up just fine and the pain went awah pretty quick. I felt ready to go ride the dirtbime before the doctor said i could. I didn't but i felt good enough to. That being said, it always felt a little bit different. Like something was off.

114,"Follow up to my mom's situation, starts bad, good ending :)","I posted awhile ago asking for advice: 

https://redd.it/9amzyx

---

My mom's been in chronic pain since I was 7 years old. At first, they thought it was just hemorrhoids, but nothing worked. I remember we shared a bed and she cried every night. She worked two jobs, one at walmart and one as a waitress at a diner. 

It ended up ruining her life. She was an avid exerciser. I remember she would bike ride/roller skate five miles before I could go play on the playground, in the Texas heat too.

They did a bunch of tests with her butt, I was too young to remember. They put her through a lot of pain with no answers. They told her she would be on laxatives for the rest of her life. It transitioned to vaginal pain. A lot of people in our family don't believe her or just brush it off. It took them almost 10 years for them to remove cysts from her ovaries which were the size of a man's hands. It helped some of the pain but it was still there.

Now she's diagnosed with a very high RA factor, fibromyalgia, and diabetes type 2. She has a ton of nerve pain and she suffers so much.

She never had insurance, we signed up for the low income healthcare our county offers when her situation first happened. It's a place where they train doctors, so every time you come in, you see someone new. For the past seven or so years, she had the same doctor. He was very kind, always called her and asked about her pain. He retired to a teaching position and is no longer seeing patients. We tried to find another doctor within the system that would treat her for her pain.

They took away basically everything except Tramadol. One time, she even went in for a refill for that and one of the doctor's didn't want to fill it. I had to call them a fucking idiot to take my mom off of something she's been on for the past 10 years. I told them they're the reasons why people end up killing themselves. They wrote enough for a week and told her to come back and find someone else that is ""more comfortable writing more."" The whole system is basically done helping anyone with pain management.

So now, we've had to look outside of the system, for a place that will accept new patients, accept to treat her condition, treats chronic pain, and actually takes cash. I literally called every place I could find in my area. I even made a spreadsheet:

https://gyazo.com/6b7ecf60ae2a1bbfadff6dfe89e1708b

We thought we found a place. We filled out all of the paper work and we were honest with the doctor that we still had refills at another pharmacy but that she was still in a lot of pain. They spun us around in circles for two weeks. First time, we aren't accepting patients that are using county insurance and they were trying to call it medicaid when it wasn't. Then, the doctor just isn't accepting any patients (after we submitted the paperwork and we were waiting for a callback). So we were pretty defeated.

We finally found a doctor that is a reasonable price, willing to see her and treat for chronic pain. My mom saw him today and said she liked him. He said she looked sad, depressed and he harped on her to quit smoking, but in a good way. ""I'll tell you just like I'll tell my mother or sister, I've seen people get their legs cut off from smoking."" We were really nervous because the place didn't really have many reviews. We thought we were going to have to wait months and months for her old prescription to run out but as long as we never fill it, then we're okay. He set her up to get an MRI and asked a bunch of questions that sparked some thought into how her nerve pain might have started.

I feel like there's some light at the end of the tunnel. We're also hoping this builds up her disability case. I wanted to post something positive on this sub and someone asked for an update. :)

I'm not going through chronic pain, but I have so much empathy for the rest of you guys. Hang in there.",

My stomach is permanently issue prone due to heavy use of NSAIDs at the doctors advice in my younger years.  So, I can't take those medications anymore.  I had a root canal done today and afterwards the dentist goes into his spiel about take some Ibuprofen.  I stopped him there and said that I couldn't take any NSAIDs, he proceeded to tell me to take Tylenol.  I said that I had been taking that to no effect for the three weeks I waited for the root canal appointment.  The antibiotic he prescribed helped with the pain more than the Tylenol.  After some back and forth he finally asked what I did for pain for my back medication wise.  I told him my typical treatment is steroids and Norco.  Then he goes on to say that Norco is overkill for a root canal.  Funny that every single root canal I have had(5) in my life have given me Norco afterwards for the pain.  I throw up my hands and say, ""fine, suffer it is"".  He paused and reluctantly wrote me a script for 2 days worth of Norco.

I am full up on suffering medical community.  When you perform surgery in my mouth have some fucking compassion.

For several reasons I'm trying to avoid prescription pills for managing my pain.

She did tell me it was called a TENS unit and what it had done for her, and I'm on board. 

I am very interested in purchasing one. They don't look expensive enough that I would want to pay for a doctor visit, but if there's some personalization programming that needs to go along with it I'd be for it, I just don't know what to expect.

128,Feel like I’m getting pushed out of my degree program because of chronic pain (x-posted to r/disability),"This is kinda rambly and emotional, but tl;dr: professor slamming me for unprofessionalism due to the need for accommodation and suggests I wouldn’t be able to teach with this disability (or that I’m handling it wrong at least)

I’m in my fifth year of college, about to graduate with a degree in special education. I started as a biology major, but after the first year I realized I wouldn’t be able to finish because a congenital eye condition I have prevents me from seeing properly through microscopes. We tried to accommodate it with assistive tech, but it wasn’t working well enough for me to see what I needed to for assignments. I think back to this a lot and seriously question if I gave up too soon and should have sought outside help or something. 

Anyway, last year I reached out to my local vocational rehab office (which I had just learned existed) to help me get through college and be at least a little bit protected from job discrimination when I graduated or tried to find summer/part-time work. I have a great relationship with them now and they help me out immensely, but nothing will change the fact that I *do* have disabilities which can’t really be “cured” or easily fixed, if at all. 

Right now, I’m working in a high school class (kind of like an internship) before I move on to my formal student teaching in the spring. My professor and I have been butting heads (often about disability issues) this year and last year. She came to observe me in the classroom yesterday and she caught me eating my lunch in the room rather than in the cafeteria with the students and my cooperating teacher. I explained that we had an unexpectedly active morning (got locked out on the other side of the school and had to walk around to the front in 90+ degree heat) and I was in a lot of pain because of it. So I chose to stay put instead (so I could participate in everything else later in the day). 

Well, that wasn’t acceptable to her. I’m supposed to be with the students/my teacher every second of the day. I understand the rules (which had never been quite clear to be honest) and I was doing the best I could to meet those expectations. But she pressed on and on about how I can’t do stuff like this when I have my own class and I’m not being professional and I have to “just push through” the pain. And believe me, I work just as hard if not harder than all the other girls in my major; I’m not a slacker, and I have never been lazy. I sometimes struggle to get things in on time, but again it’s a disability thing (slow processing and executive functioning issues). She’s been shitting on me as well about missing class for doctors appointments, some of which take months to schedule and can’t be made outside of school hours. 

Anything I can do to be in class and be prepared and on top of things, I will do. I have as much documentation on file as I can fiscally afford to obtain. I work my ass off to get everything done like I’m supposed to, but it feels like every tiny mistake I make is blown up, while everyone else gets by so easily. 

Honestly, I worry about finishing this degree. I won’t even teach if it’s that big of a deal (though some of my loans would be forgiven if I do teach for like 5 years or so), but I need to graduate and be done and be able to get a job that makes decent money (as in, not minimum wage!). I don’t know if they’ll let me continue if I keep fucking up like this, but at the same time I feel like I can’t “work harder” or “push past it.” I’m doing the best I can! I literally have to come home and lay down every day after school because I have given all my energy to this and I have none left for myself, my fiancé, or any of our plans. Getting homework done is hard enough, forget making dinner! 

I’ve just kinda been in crisis mode all day today and yesterday because I’m just so upset about this and I don’t know what to do. I’m scared to talk to my professor more, and nobody else seems to understand. Even my fiancé is struggling to be supportive and understanding, because chronic pain and fatigue just don’t make sense when you don’t experience them. I’m angry at myself for wasting all this time and money when clearly I can’t do this. ",

131,Compounding Question,"Hi,

My awesome local pharmacy recommended a mixture of lidocaine, flexiril(cyclobenzaprine), and magnesium as a compounded gel, which they would make, to mitigate neck pain.   They approached both my general practitioner and my neurologist and both refused to write the prescription (I'm in the USA).   No reason was given, but I was not part of the conversation.   I'm wondering if anyone else has had such an experience and what their solution was.  My next step is to go the pain clinic I frequent and see whether they would write the prescription, but it takes a month to get an appointment, and it's expensive.  

I respond well to each of these ingredients independently, and have had them prescribed, though I've only tried flexiril orally at 10 milligrams, I have not tried flexiril topically.

133,When is enough enough!!??,"I just need to rant/cry some. Sorry it’s so long. This is my first post on here and I need to vent. I had medial branch radio-frequency ablation done on my right side L3-S1 on Friday the 24th. I had 2 sets of test MBBs done and both were successful with no complications, so I went into this with great hopes that FINALLY something was going to work.  When I woke up from the anesthesia, I could not feel or move my right leg. By far the scariest moment of my life!  I was able to wiggle my toes, and the nurse tells me this is normal and the feeling and movement will come back in my leg. So ok.. I can calm back down, and the right side of my back feels pretty good! Things seem to being working out for once.  So, since I can’t move or feel my right leg, my fiancé has me using the rolling computer chair to get to and from the bathroom safely. I was doing great! Until Bam! I fucking fell trying to pull my pants up after going to the bathroom. My right leg just went out to the side and I went down almost all the way to a full split!  I am no where near flexible enough to be doing the splits!  At the time nothing hurt because I could not feel my right leg at all. Well, as the days passed I got some of the feeling back in my leg and my hip has begun to hurt pretty bad.  Notice how I said some of the feeling back. I saw my doctor on Monday and yet another MRI has been ordered and more narcotic pain meds have been prescribed. My hip is killing me and so is my back. My back is worse than it was before the ablation. We don’t know if the increased pain if from the fall or the reaction to the ablation and the nerves healing. Also we don’t now if the continued loss of feeling in my right leg is from the ablation or the fall.  My MRI isn’t until Friday and I don’t see the doctor again until Monday next week. So here I sit with this BS running through my head. Did this procedure fuck up my leg or did I fuck in my leg and back after my back was finally getting better???? It’s just one thing after another! Nothing has ever worked or gone the way it was supposed to. When do I just raise my white flag?! I want my old life back! 

UPDATE:  It is now Saturday 9/1. I have gotten more of the feeling and movement back in my right leg.  However, the more feeling I have gotten back, the more pain I feel. My right leg hurts from my hip to just below my knee. It’s a strange combination of pains. Burning, aching, and sharp pains. My ice packs have been my best friends, like always! Let’s be honest, I have no friends, only 2 have bothered to even stay in contact with me and only one has come to visit me since I became unable to work or drive a little over a year ago. I have been stuck at home for a year and one friend has visited me!  I made it through the MRI on Friday- yay Ativan! Hopefully will get some straight answers on Monday at the dr.

It may not be the worst pain possible, but it’s up there. And yet when I try to explain that I’ve tried all the other methods of pain relief including recently getting a spinal cord stimulator and that I’m not receiving enough pain relief to make it I’m met with stony faces or condescending looks. I’ve ended up having to take a sick day a week even though I’m working 100% from home right now because the pain is laying me out. I just want to be able to work, do some things around the house and be able to spend some real time with my young son.

I ended up on work restrictions for a total of 4.5 months, with a ten day stint of 24/7 in wrist braces and on meloxicam. It took some time after that ten days, but my right wrist seems to have fully healed.

But not my left. So I've got a 6 month restriction to have plenty of time to get this fixed. In my left, over the last month (about 2 weeks after my last doctor visit in which my right was fine), I've developed pressure/usage related numbness in my left thumb and first finger. It gets worse when I need to use my left hand, which at work entails sorting boxes. Pushing the boxes to the correct sortation belt leads to those two fingers going numb. 

I haven't lost any strength or feeling. My doc did a test using a device with little pins on it about 2mm apart and I have no problem telling how many pins were used to test my touch reception. I just have this overlaying feeling of numbness or pins and needles.

I also have hypermobility, so my fingers bend back a little too much, which she says may be contributing to the issue as the problem is worst when the pressure which causes numbness is concentrated at the joint of the last knuckle, on the bottom of my thumb/finger. 

I have an appointment for some ultrasound therapy thing in a couple weeks, but until then, I'm trying to find ideas that could protect those finger joints and reduce the numb feeling. 

It's not painful but it's incredibly uncomfortable and gets to the point I can't use those fingers because it is *SO* uncomfortable.

The surgeon comes in with the two from before and doesn't waste much time.  He informed me that my right hip socket was not shaped properly.  On top of that my hips are tilted weird due to week glute muscles and weak abdominal muscles, which in turn has caused arthritis in both of my hips.

I'm 25 and already have arthritis in my hips.  

The plus side is he wants me to try physio first, and can do injections if I need them.  He's very reluctant to do surgery because the type I would need is only just being explored and hasn't proven it works.

I'm both happy and very upset at the same time.  I'm so sick of the pain, I just want even one day where I don't wake up with aching hips.

I guess it's time to see my therapist, because despite physio bring an option again to fix things I just feel... Hopeless, because of it doesn't work I don't know if I can handle this.",

144,I have had heel pain since 2009 and nothing is working!,"Hi guys, new to Reddit but wanted to seek more opinions on this reoccurring issue I've had with my foot. I am a 29 year old active female, exercise 4-6X/week, 5'10. I've kept a timeline (which I pasted below) starting from when the issue arose which includes  the treatment I've received along with other notes I found relevant.  Any advice/opinions would be greatly appreciated!

May 2009 - Minor pain in right foot began
May 2009 - Began wearing insoles and pain was controlled
October 2010 - Trained and ran half-marathon with minor pain
March 2012 - Pain progressively got worse in both feet, saw orthopedic surgeon – x-rays, surgeon thought it may be cysts in my feet
April 2012 - MRI on right foot confirmed no cysts, plantar fascia did not show typical signs of plantar fasciitis
April 2012 - Steroid shots in both feet led to minor relief
May 2012 - Saw podiatrist, foot brace on right foot consistently for 3 months, oral anti-inflammatory for 3 months, topical anti-inflammatory for 3 months, stopped running routine for &gt; 1 year
May 2013 - Saw chiropractor for about 6 sessions, targeted vibration therapy
May 2014 - Saw podiatrist, steroid shot right foot, prescription orthotics, boot on right foot for 6 weeks
June 2014 - MRI on right foot to see if any hairline fractures exist, confirmed no hairline fracture, plantar fascia did not show signs of plantar fasciitis, no improvement in pain
June 2014 - Began weekly physical therapy sessions, continued stretches and exercises
Summer 2015 - Saw orthopedic specialist who suggested $1,600 shock wave therapy (did not go with therapy as is not covered by insurance)
March 2016 - Saw orthopedic specialist and got x-rays, received custom orthotics
April 2016 - Saw chiropractor about 3 sessions
August 2016 - Steroid shots in both feet, hiked 27 miles in Peru with minor issues and taped heels
January 2017 - Moved to Denver and saw new orthopedic specialist and got more x-rays, said problem was anterior cavus deformity, suggested surgery: Dorsiflexed ray first metatarsal osteotomy, plantar fasciitis surgery
February 2017 - Second opinion on surgery, suggested not to get surgery, recommended another MRI and seeing rheumatologist
March 2017 - Third opinion on surgery, suggested only plantar fascia release which would be somewhat exploratory
April 3, 2017 - Right plantar fascia release, found some scar tissue that was not shown on x-rays, ruled out nerve entrapment
April – June 2017 - Physical therapy sessions once/twice per week for at least 6 weeks
April 20, 2018 - Saw Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation physician assistant who suggested I return for a steroid shot in my ankle to rule out tendonitis
May 24,2 018 -Returned to PM&amp;R office for steroid shot – physician did not see signs of tendonitis in ankle (using ultrasound), recommended a gait analysis from a chiropractor (not covered by insurance) and platelet rich plasma therapy (also not covered by insurance)

Additional info: 
1.	I have pain in both feet in the same area, but it is worse in my right foot (I am right handed)
2.	My foot never hurt worse with the first few steps out of bed in the morning until after the plantar fascia release
3.	My feet hurt worse at the end of the day than at the beginning, and more severely after:
    -1 hour + of standing or slow walking (running errands, etc.)
    -Any amount of running
    -Any amount of hiking (max is about 6 miles)
    -The most pain I have never felt was skiing in rented ski boots – I thought something in my foot was going to rupture - the best way I can describe this is it felt like a knife poking in the bone of my right heel
4.	I thought the surgery was mildly successful because the following next ski season I had less pain; however, I believe this is because I purchased new boots rather than renting used boots for the season
5.	I have some nerve sensitivity in my ankle that has not always been present, I think this came about within the last two years or so
6.	The strasburg sock makes my feet fall asleep
7.	I do know that I have tight calves, but even with PT and stretching nothing seems to make much of a difference

147,Anyone have experience with false negatives with a drug screen?,"I’ll try and keep this short: herniated a disc and after a decade pain got bad enough to seek treatment. Was on methadone and Percocet from 2009-2013 from a pain clinic and subjected to urine tests and pill counts. No problem. 


In 2013 after having taken methadone daily, I have to stress that is DAILY, for almost for years I got a test back that was negative for methadone (but positive for Percocet). Again I took methadone DAILY, multiple times per day. Never missing a day.  

Anyhow, doctor mercifully allowed me to continue treatment but with tramadol. I was surprised, but it works as well for me as methadone every did. Since that test though, I began recording my self taking my tramadol for several days before my appointments so I’d have proof of taking my meds if I ever were to have another false negative. 


I rarely get tested anymore. I’m self pay and it’s expensive for my visits, plus I get billed a couple hundred for the drug test. I think they do cut me some slack because of the expense.  It’s a gc ms test that is sent away to a lab. I had an appt a week and a half ago and of course forget to record myself leading up to the appt. What do ya know they drug test me. 


Now, I’ve been freaking out about the prospect of a false negative. Getting booted from treatment may mean losing my business, my home, my daughters education, etc. 


Again, this hasn’t happened yet or anything but my mind has been stuck on the what if’s. I’ve since cut my dose of daily tramadol in half just in preparation of the potential disaster, so I’m in pain, can’t sleep, am depressed, and anxious as hell to the point of being physically sick. Anyone have any experience with fighting a false negative just in case? ",
148,Anyone on Zohydro ER? I got my first prescription free and they claim the remaining ones will be $20. Anyone take this stuff.,"FIRST OFF: I am VERY happy with Zydydro ER, it provides hydrocodone at a continuous release rate instead of the spikes of IR medication.  This stuff is LIFE CHANGING. 

After years at my old Pain Clinic getting a solid NO to getting anything more than 4 10mg/325 narcotic pills a day I moved to Florida and found a doctor that wanted to know why I wasnt being treated with Extended Release instead of 4 Spikes or relief a day from 4 IR pills.

I am so lucky.  Retired AND found a doctor interested in getting me some relief.

She sent the prescription to somewhere in California that handles this medication and they sent the first 60 pill (2x12 hours a day) bottle for free (like all good drug dealers: First one is free ;) ) and said that they would use a discount coupon if my insurance won't cover it (It Wont, of course) to bring it down to $20 instead of the like $1,000 a month it lists for.

They said if I put in an attempt to get Workers Comp to pay for it and they didn't (it is a workers comp accident) then it would no longer be the $20 a fill, but the full list price with no chance of using the coupon again.  Seemed weird, I thought I could try Workers Comp then fall back on their 'coupon price', but it appears it is an Hard OR!

Not complaining, this medication is AWESOME and provides relief through the day and allows me to sleep for longer periods of time between needing to take a 1/2 a pill in the middle of the night.  Now my PCP/Pain Doc is doubling my dose per pill so that I can get rid of the breakthrough pain medication, which I WANT TO. It was so freaky the first day it fully took effect and I didn't have to run to the bottle all day.

I am just confused about the pricing, coupons, and what happens when the coupon expires and they start charging me the full amount after I have gotten used to not being in terrifying pain all day, or not be able to plan on doing something Monday night because I don't know what Monday's activities will do to my shoulder.",
149,Written Prescription Hassle,"So today I got my first taste of how much a pain in the ass it is to have to get a written prescription for narcotics. 

I have been seen for around a year now for chronic back/neck pain  by a rheumatologist who suspects I have ""AS"" or some auto-immune issue. She hasn't been able to find evidence in images including x-rays, mri, and CT scane, but I did have the HLAB27 gene. 

With that being said, yesterday she decided to help me out with a small script of #12 hydrocodone as I have been having a rough time. She informed me that I would have to come in the next morning and pick it up. So i drive all the way into the  middle of town ( I live in a major city) pick up my prescription, show my id, sign for it, and leave. Then I go to 3 different pharmacies trying to find one that open before 9am. I finally just decide to drive back to my area of town and go to my normal pharmacy, and then they tell me they are out of the prescription. Then it turns out they had just enough to fill mine which was only for #12. Then on top of that my insurance refuses to pay for the prescription for 10/325 hydrocodone, because they said i'm too young to be on that strength. 

All of this could have been prevented by simply calling it in over the phone the evening before, and they simply send me a text when its ready. 

Good lord, I can't imagine what it's like for people who have to go to pain management every month and go through this ridiculous bullshit. WTF has our government done to us. Very very sad how much hoops we have to jump through and how much they have screwed chronic pain patients.

154,Good career for chronic back/neck pain surferer,"I need some advice on careers. I currently work on cell phone towers doing brutal manual labor working 40 - 60 hours a week. It's extremely hard on the body and requires climbing 100s of feet in the air wearing 30lb harness. 

I have been having more problems with back/neck pain over the last couple of months. My doctors thinks I could have spondalytis or something similar. I think I have some type of imflammatory ilness as I have had more bloodshot eyes, morning stiffness, back/neck pain, fatigue, and red puffy nuckles. 

It has become increasingly difficult to do my job to the point where I am taking short term leave. 

With that being said I am considering a career change. I believe I can still do some light manual labor type jobs, but heavy lifting, long hours outside are probably out of the question. 

With that being said what are some good careers that pay decent and are easy on the body. I am good with a computer and IT is a potential interest, and I can type very fast. ",

I always have, but ever since this pain started, it's sooo much worse, and the two problems feed each other. The pain makes me not want to engage with people, which makes the anxiety worse, and whenever the anxiety is worse, the pain is worse. I'm also at college, and it's a very small college and pretty much everyone knows everyone or at least recognizes them, so there's like nowhere to hide, and I end up walking around campus or attending my classes feeling like I've been repeatedly stabbed in the abdomen. Sometimes the pain will be like a jolt, and I'll react, and feel humiliated because I'm sure it looks weird to anyone who doesn't know the situation... I try to just live my life like normal, but the pain making the anxiety worse and vice versa is sooooo hard to deal with I'm at the point where I'm forcing myself to even do anything. Does anyone else have this problem of chronic pain and social anxiety, and how do you cope? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Sorry for the long post. ",
162,Got my RFA today,"I had my RFA procedure I’ve been waiting months for today. Aside from the delay getting in the OR, it went so smooth. Usually for me, I have zero concerns going in, it’s coming out, and maybe it was because I’ve been to this surgery center 3 times now, know the nurses and OR team by name, but this time I did not have the insanity that happens when I wake up from sedation. Yes... sedation, never even had general and honestly afraid to because of how bad sedation gets me. I usually take a while to wake up, and when I do, I usually do a lot of crying, sometimes screaming and convulsing. This time while I did struggle to wake up and did bawl my eyes out I did not shake, didn’t have some insane heart rate. To me it was as smooth as it could get. The nurse anesthetist came out and I think he remembered my case and asked if stuff happens when I get sedated, I said the above, maybe he gave me less or something. Also for once I do remember stuff happening and granted while I did still knock out like a light, I do remember a moment of feeling burning. They said they’d ask me to wake up and ask if I feel a thumping or surge in my back (hopefully not my leg) but I do not remember, I asked the circulator and she did say I talked in the procedure, so weird! 

While I go a HUGE warning from both the discharge instructions and my doctor I did not expect the amount of pain I would be in when I woke up and just today and up to 2 weeks... I’m so used to waking up feeling like a new person because of nerve blocks. This was different, I was just told “Your pain will be flared up and you will not feel relief instantly, but the pain will be more of an internal sunburn feeling” maybe it’s because I’ve only had one sunburn in my life, I just assumed I’d come out feeling the same as I came in with just sore injection sites, but no, it’s intense... I cannot get comfortable at all... the soreness and burning is horrid. I do not have pain meds and was not prescribed any (I wouldn’t take them likely if they asked or prescribed it anyhow) usually the type to just endure pain, but not being able to sleep or even finding a comfortable position is so hard. 

Is this what you guys had when you had them? I know they don’t work for some people but did you experience pain after and then it’d go away? I should have mentioned, I had 6 done at once, 3 on each side of my L3-L5, some when I said I was going to get this said that’s a lot but my doctor is conscious and I don’t think he’d do that many at once if he didn’t think I could take it or it was dangerous. He did my stellate ganglion blocks one at a time which to me is crazy, so I think he’d do one side at a time if he thought it was dangerous. 

Definitely will update y’all on the results and if it worked for me in ~2 weeks when they said I should get relief. ",4

I haven't noticed much improvement, in fact I am getting bouts of severe nausea because I am being blind sided by random flare ups. I can't eat, sleep, walk, study.

I have mild scoliosis and it is causing me S.I joint pain. I have recently been diagnosed. The pain has improved but it is still uncomfortable to sit for a long time and I often need to walk, stand or rest by laying down for relief. Its a dull achey pain but it used to be unbearable sharp stabbing pains. 

 Im scared of it getting worse due to the 45 minute drive, because the pain has already improved so much. Im nervous about getting weird looks because i walk funny due to pain. And i bought a memory foam cushion for my car, but if i find it unbearable sitting in class, ill have to bring it with me which will suck. I cant ask for accommodations until i see my specialist who ive waited weeks to hear from. I also hate the idea of explaining to new friends about this condition. Or be given weird looks if i need to stand during class. 

I plan on communicating with my teachers and will lay in my car during breaks when needed. I might have to study in my car too lol. Thats gonna kill the uni experience for me.

Has anyone had the same fears when starting school? I know i shouldnt care what people think, but id be uncomfortable with people just noticing or being curios with the things ill need to do in order to alleviate my pain. ",

178,Stupid decisions,"Have any of you ever been prescribed a controlled substance and chose to get addicted to it? 
I know this sounds incredibly dumb..

On top of my chronic pain and nausea I have anxiety. 
Some days the only way I can function is with a lorazepam or two in me. 

Lately I've just wanted to escape the everyday anxiety, pain, and all around monotony of life.
I've been hooked on them before, but then it was caused by a Dr while in the hospital.. it was a fd up 2 years with a bad habit..

Maybe I've just been down from the pain and anxiety in overdrive lately, and feeling like a failure and weakling. I just wake up sick everyday, take a pill for one symptom or another, then load up on supplements in hopes they help, and by the time I'm at work I'm mentally battling myself, then when I'm home I just get lonely and feel helpless to the circumstances I live in.. then I look at my bank account and think of all my bills and how little I'm able to work.. and I just want to check out. 

I'd rather be high, happy and blind to my afflictions.

It's incredibly dumb I know. Seems like if I'm not battling my body I'm battling my mind. I've never considered myself an addict, or been treated for being one. I guess I'm just a guy who just wants a few good days without the weight of the world on his shoulders for a moment or two.

191,Update: 2nd spinal cord surgery,"So on Wednesday morning at 9am I was wheeled into the operating room.  

My rod and pedicle screws were taken out of my L5-S1.  They relieved the compression on my nerves.  My fusion was SO solid the surgeon was amazed.

I woke up in recovery at like 10:30am.  They were hitting me with morphine every 10 minutes.

The surgeon decided I needed to stay overnight.  I was up and walking within hours of getting to my room.  

I hate peeing in bedpans so I got up and made my way to the restroom.  There was pain in my left hip that made me scream out with every move.

24 mg of IV morphine every 3 hrs and 10mg of oxycodone every 4.  2 mg of ativan every 12 along with 600mgs of gabapentin every 8.  

My ass was asleep a lot.  They woke me twice the first day to walk around the nurses station and do some exercises.

I stayed 2 and a half days.  I'm vegetation so I got the same 3 vegetables for lunch and dinner. I lived on kozy shack sugar free vanilla pudding.  

I'm waiting on a hemiplegic walker.  I got out the hospital on Friday afternoon.  Got some Jack in the Box and slept and til this morning.  I walked around my apt complex.

My bandages have been changed every morning.  I have a 6 inch incision.

193,"Got a couple questions concerning my mom, chronic pain for 15+yrs.","I'm not going to say too much but our situation got bad.

She's in the low income county health system and got passed around from doctor to doctor. She finally found a doctor and he has stuck by her side for the past 7 or so years. He gave us fair warning, but last December, he retired to a teaching position. So we've been going around looking for a new doctor within the system that would follow her same pain management plan.

None of the doctors want anything to do with it. They've taken away 2 different medications and left her on just Tramadol. We even went in for a refill on that one and one of the doctors didn't even want to refill that. I blew up and I was like how the fuck are you going to take away something she's been on for over 10 years? They gave her like a week prescription and told her to come in again when a doctor is there that will feel more comfortable writing it.

Anyways, now we are looking outside the system for a pain management doctor. The only problem is, my mom still has like four refills left on her Tramadol. She's still in massive pain without her other meds and we've already gone to the hospital once.

Is there any way to ""cancel"" out the refills? I found a pain management place that is willing to take her on as a patient but as soon as I told them about the remaining refills, they told us that they wouldn't be able to write her anything until those refills are gone (which is understandable) and that they would most likely recommend injections (something we can't afford). 

I just want to know if there's any way to get her in to pain management sooner, I can't go through seeing her every day in massive pain. ",
194,"I am free of hydrocodone, at last","I have multiple sclerosis and spinal stenosis, and I have been on a cocktail of neuro drugs and painkillers for years. My cognition has been affected and the hydrocodone kept nagging at me, never providing enough pain relief, daring me to ask my pain management doctor for more. We all know how miserable life is, having to dope up just to function. 

In mid-July, I signed up for my state's medical cannabis oil program via the MS center where I am treated. I was told that before I could begin to reduce the amount of gabapentin that I take, I would need to come off hydrocodone. My pain management doctor was on board, and laid out a strategy for tapering. However, he had no experience with tapering off opioids and onto cannabis oil, so I needed to do some creative googling to supplement his directions.

I took the process very slowly, first finding a base oil formula where I felt painless; then starting to reduce the dose by cutting each hydrocodone pill in half. I was taking three doses a day, so I started with the mid-day dose. Cut it in half, take a dose of oil along with the half pill, and do that for a few days until my body got used to the reduced dose. And so on.

Now it was the most difficult when I got down to that last half-pill, which was the morning dose. My body was doing some withdrawal tricks there and I kept looking over at that bottle, but I resisted. And I'll tell you it seems like taking more of these opioids makes the pain worse, or you feel the pain worse as you reduce your dose or something. But finally, I dropped that last half pill, and now, a week later--

I feel so much better. I take a .50 mL dose of low-thc cannabis oil (it does have thc in it though) and sometimes a couple of ibuprofin if I feel I need it, and I feel much more energized and capable than when I was on hydrocodone. It's not as if I have zero pain; but the pain I have is better managed, and the depressive side effects of the opioid are starting to clear.

That is my story. I hope it can help somebody!",3

201,Tips for Dealing w/ Insurance RE: Coverage of P/T,"Hello r/ChronicPain! Long time lurker, (I think) first time poster. I've definitely posted in r/migraine. Can't remember if I've written here or not. What brings me here today is an insurance question.

I have a herniated disc that stems from an auto accident over 3 years ago. It required extensive physical therapy when it was first injured but then the need for care dissipated. Now, it flairs up from time to time in a small way, like for a day or two. However, I did something about 2 months ago (picked up a baby) and it went back out again long term and has caused long term sciatica, similar to the original injury.

My doctor referred me to physical therapy, which I knew was the best course of action, and I've been going for about a month now. My insurance waited over a month to contest my charges and now they say they don't think they need to pay for it because the original injury was caused by an auto accident.

My question is- at what point do we draw the line? To me, I was out of physical therapy for the initial injury (car accident) for almost 2 years and consider this to be an entirely new incident (picking up the baby). Am I going to be on the hook and need to pay out of pocket EVERY SINGLE TIME I need physical therapy for the rest of my life? That just isn't feasible.

How do I contest this with my insurance? Where do I even begin? Am I bound to lose this battle? Should I just get used to shitty life with my shitty back?",

He said he'd refill my pain meds for every THREE MONTHS and looked over my MRI to see the best path for me and what to do next.

Meanwhile someone gets diagnosed with an illness they brought on themselves, isn't fatal and is curable, just makes them sick for a week, and they get an unbelievable outpouring of support on a daily basis all the way through it.

No I don't want people getting sick, self-inflicted or not.  It would be better if nobody ever got sick.  But people suck and life is stupid.  No wonder so many of us fall into addictions and/or homelessness.  People know it can't be fixed so just kind of sort of want you to die, or at the very least turn into something that they can now say ""Look you are bringing it on yourself because you are addicted/homeless, yes as a result of the illness going untreated for so long but LALALALA WE CAN'T HEAR YOU, our hands are clean of you, goodbye!""",

But I haven’t seen many talk about the less than spectacular perks that go hand in hand with chronic pain or how they deal with them.

Things like the horror of constipation so bad you give serious consideration to trying to pull the stubborn one blocking up the works with your fingers

Or the depression from having to give up huge chunks of your life and not being able to do the things that once brought happiness. The bike gathering dust, the weights with spiderwebs on them, ingredients and that will never be used because prepping food, cooking food, and cleaning up after is just too much.

And the anger that sometimes comes with a dash of frustration every time you have to explain how you might not look sick but your body is in a constant state of agonizing pain. Or you’re told how surely it’s not that bad and you should try yoga or a heating-pad or blood sacrifice to a deity of your choice, cause i did that when my shoulder hurt that one time.",

I struggle so much with sleep. I've had two sleep studies done and have tried every sleep medication ever made, seen specialists, done accupuncture, chiropractor, massages, yoga, exercises, natural herbs, melatonin, essential oils, hot baths, been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist, etc etc etc. Nothing works. I can be ""asleep"" for 10 hours and my Fitbit says I get MAYBE 3- 4 of actual sleep (multiple sleep doctors have told me the Fitbit sleep trackers are actually really accurate depictions). My Fitbit graphs look ridiculous with how much disruption I get every night. The last sleep study I did says I don't have sleep apnea anymore, and couldn't find an actual sleep disorder. They just said I never really get to my REM cycle, and have very disruptive sleep. My nuerologist said I should find another sleep specialist and all she told me was I probably have such disruptive sleep bc of pain. 

I have horrible nightmares every night and feel like they're caused by pain and stress. Stress from the pain too if that makes sense. I'm about to start trying to get pregnant and will have to get off of the current sleep medication I'm on (which obviously doesn't work anyway) and I'm scared at how miserable I'll be with even less sleep.

I keep catching hints of an idea going around that opioids effect the users perceptions intensely and that one of the effects of that is the very ability to know that that's happening to you. This feels really dangerous to me because it reminds me of the dehumanizing propaganda that one often sees during war time. Though in this case, it's essentially giving doctors an out as to why what ever you say, it's certainly not correct and the effects of the medication. It feels like it lets them feel ok with denying urgently needed care because they are so sure you can't be right. I don't doubt this can happen, but denying someone the benefit of the doubt in such a broad way seems like a recipe for disaster. I laid out several facts about my current situation that were measured in real hours of productivity lost for work, and yet in the doctors response to me, it seemed as though they practically ignored the details and severity of what I had documented.

1. Cervical injections: does anybody get these for chronic neck pain and does it help? When looking for pain management places covered by my insurance, I found one that does these. 

2. Good pillows: any suggestions? I sleep on my side. My neck pain runs along the sides of my neck in those main muscles or whatever those bulging things are. I need more support and for my neck not to have to hold anything up. 

Any other suggestions would work too. I'm wanting to go back to part time school in a month (after a year absence) and I won't be able to if I don't relieve some of this pain!",

222,"Stepping down from a full-time supervisory role with benefits into a part-time role much further down the food chain due to health after 3 months leave of absence, and it sucks.","I’m trying so hard to remember all of the positives. 

This time three months ago, I was in the middle of a never-ending migraine. This time two months ago I was hospitalized. This time one month ago I was still bed-bound from symptoms. So being able to return work in any form is a blessing, and one that not many are able to do. I know this. 

My new part time hours will allow for two full days off during the week to schedule doctors appointments without having to ask off from work, which I previously was not able to do. This will allow me to manage my health much better than I was when I was working full time. This will give me more time to rest, and more time with my family. 

My new position will also relieve me of the stress of having to be responsible for managing my team through my issues with my own health. It also has the added perk of moving me from under a manager I butted heads with quite often to a manager I used to work under previously whom I know I work very well with. I am also moved so far down the ladder doing tasks that are very mundane and routine, so as close to stress-free as I can get. 

All of this sounds so perfect. I am so grateful that this was a solution that was available. In the past, I have lost so many jobs when my health became too much to handle. At the end of the day I am able to help support my family this way. Please don’t misunderstand me - I know that I’m more fortunate than some and I’m grateful to be able to do what I can. This feeling still sucks. 

It sucks that I’ve worked so hard for three years to build a career just to have to fall back down to having to be satisfied with “just a job”...and really just the reality that with my chronic illness that I may never have a career but may need to be satisfied with just a job. For a type A personality this is a special type of heartbreak that I’m not really sure how to get over. Any suggestions?

223,"New Dr., new problems... Vent","Need a little venting...

So I got switched to another new PCP through the VA. This woman who I have never met and who spent approximately 5 minutes looking over my file which details extensively, EVERYTHING I’ve tried for pain... Her recommendation for pain management after 1.5 years (I know a lot less than most of you, but ruining my life all the same) of chronic pain in the entire right side of my body, and from the left hip down, to try YOGA AND DEEP BREATHING! 

When I started crying out of sheer frustration because my life has been so completely and utter thrown off track because of my pain, she walked me through her “pain cycle”. Injury &gt; pain &gt; stress &gt; depression &gt; more pain. As if I had never ever thought of this! 

When I finally got to why I had the appointment in the first place, which was to follow up on the naproxen I was prescribed last month to help reduce my pain and help me sleep for more than 2 hours at a time... she started treating me like I was a junky trying to score. 

I am learning to understand more and more why there are so many suicides among those with chronic pain. Sometimes a bullet feels like the easiest option in the world.

227,Gabapentin Withdrawal,"I was prescribed 600mg of gabapentin for neuropathic pain. I had to reschedule a follow-up appointment with my doctor because of my work schedule. When I went to get the medication refilled I was told the doctor refused the refill request with the message that I needed to make an appointment to discuss it. I already have an appointment.. when I called the office I was told by his nurse that any medication requests had to be discussed during an appointment. I have epilepsy, but have not had a seizure in like a decade, so the medication was not treating that. I breastfeed an 18 month old. I will go 5-6 days without the gabapentin.. should I be concerned that both of us will be experiencing withdrawal? I will not be staying with this doctor because I feel that this was VERY irresponsible and scary, is there any way I can file a formal complaint?

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: I ended up seeing him yesterday.. and I'm so non-confrontational that I didn't even mention it. He ended up prescribing me 800mg, without me asking, and also tried to give me hydrocodone, which I refused. The good news is.. the only withdrawal symptoms my daughter and I had were basically a LOT of anxiety and irritation.

234,I need to celebrate with folks who will understand.,"Two years ago my pain management doctor retired and his clinic and patients were bought. The clinic that bought his patients was, unfortunately, deplorable. (Basically a pill mill). I couldn't stand going there as a legitimately ill person (I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome) and I wanted out, but as many of you know switching pain management doctors isn't easy and it doesn't look good if you bounce around so I wanted to be sure that I found a good one before I made the move.

Unfortunately before I could switch my horrible Clinic was under investigation and began rapidly and forcibly lowering dosages without cause a reason for everyone regardless of their situation or diagnosis. 

They cut my long acting medication in half with no tapering, and with it, destroyed my life. 

Coaching my son's soccer, going on occasional trips, driving, cooking, walking my dog... Any of it, even in small amounts, wasn't happening. After seven years- my entire life was pretty much over. 

I switch to a major Hospital Network and met with the head of pain management who agreed that my care was not being handled properly and they took me on as a patient but after finally moving to their practice the physician's assistant that I saw from month to month all but refused to return my medication to where it had been citing the pressure on doctors and political situation and said that because I've been on that new lower dose for almost 5 months she was just going to keep me there. 

I had a spinal cord stimulator implanted. I did everything possible and did everything humanly possible to explain the situation.. I fought months of hopeless depression and suicidal thoughts- so angry and frustrated that the government bullshit and the behavior of addicts was making it impossible for me to get proper care... 

It took one year of a battle- but this morning they increased my ER morphine back to 100 mg every twelve hours. 

I insisted my mom come with me today because my inability to function affects her more than anyone- she's had to care for the house, my animals and my son because of my increased pain. Since my husband couldn't come to this appointment- and I'm SO glad she did. I fully believe her presence was what finally pushed the doctor to listen me. 


I REALLY really hope that when the doctor sees that I'm NOT going to keep asking for increases - that she'll stand by this decision. (I'm the previous seven years, is never had a single increase, ACTUALLY I'd reduced my breakthrough medication three times voluntarily!)

For 7 years I was well maintained, and for a year I've been struggling SO badly with my pain out of control. I sincerely hope this gives me back the ability to function like I had been. 

Going to get this filled is a HUGE feeling of freedom. I can't tell you how relieved I am. One year of fighting for this increase. One year of being in far too much pain for no reason. Here's to hoping that by tomorrow, I'm feeling more like my old self. &lt;3

236,Broke my back 3 years ago. Have questions about epidurals and nerve ablation,"Im 18, when i was 15 i fell off a mountain and broke my t7-t12 vertebrae. No surgery ever. Pain has gotten much worse within the last year and ive been doing PT for about a month. Apparently My thoracic spine curvature is exaggerated which results in the lumbar curvature too being exaggerated and most of the weight of my upper back being held by the muscles in my lower back rather than my core and hips. At PT i do mobility exercises for my back and core / hip strengthening exercises. My pt is great but it has not helped my pain that much. The residual level is better but i still cannot stand up for morethan 30 minutes and i spend the entire afternoon at home in pain trying to get comfortable, never able to go out. I use my mornings to get stuff out of the way but by around 3 pm im completely done. Im in so much pain every time i go out to do anything and i have to take so many breaks a lot of times i just end up sitting on the sidewalk. I live in manhattan so driving is not an option and walking + public transit is really taking its toll. 

I asked my ortho for a pain management clinic referral over the phone, and he sent me to a physiatrist at a rehabilitation department in the same hospital as him. She observed some arthritis on my MRI in the joints at the bottom of my spine (i cant be more specific) and recommended that we proceed with PT but do an epidural in the right nerve (most of my pain is in my lower right back) next week as a diagnostic procedure. The logic is that if the epidural reduces the pain, then the arthritis in those nerves is what is causing my pain, and we will move on to ablating both the right and left nerves down there. She told me all of this and then said if i am not comfortable with it we can go the medication route but she was hesitant because im a student and i need to be clear headed (well i need to not be in pain to even make it to class....) and then said that the medications she usually prescribes, gabapentin or a muscle relaxer might have a bunch of side effects. I opted for the epidural for now because i know gabapentin doesnt do anything for me and id like to at least try it. But ive heard there are some potentially bad side effects to the ablation. I also read its only like a 50% success rate. 

So im looking for some advice regarding the side effects of the epidural and ablation and anything else you guys have for me. Id like to get into see a real pain management doctor but clearly my ortho is not big on this. With school starting next week i know this is going to become an even bigger issue than it already is. I really want to get my back better so im willing to try whatever. Ive been swimming a mile - 2 miles every day (i quit swimming competitively when i broke my back and havent since) for about a week and it feels great. Also weedreally helps with my pain but i heard any pm doctor will kick me out for pissing dirty. I could get my medical card for chronic pain here, would that change anything? Thanks for any advice",

Called yesterday, not ready. Called today, not ready but they would let them know to ""rush"" it. I stressed that I needed to get it today, but it didn't matter.


 So now I'm on day 8 of my 7 day patch and looking at possibly another delay if the pharmacy is out of stock. 


I've been on this for 2+years. It took over 1 year for them to note that it was a 28 day Rx and not the standard 30 day.


I'm frustrated. It wouldn't be the first time that notation got deleted from my records. Tomorrow won't be the first day I've had to go and sit in the office waiting room until the doctor signs the paper RX.


I'm so sick of being in pain and relying on this patch, but I know that if I have to go without it I'll be in so much more pain. If I hadn't been having back spasms last week I wouldn't have anything else to take for pain (doc gave me 10 days worth of cyclobenzaprine) because my doc is so worried about getting in trouble with the DEA.

As you all know, changing doctors is something you have to take seriously and as such, I tried to find a new one without leaving there first. 

Six months in, I had my long acting meds cut in half for no reason and with no tapering. It destroyed my life and my ability to be a mother and to live my life. I fought through suicidal thoughts and months and months of severe depression and hopelessness. 

When I found a new doctor, by meeting the head of pain management for a large area hospital, they agreed to take me on as a patient. When I met with the PA however, she didn't want to change my meds, citing government pressure..

I had a spinal cord stim implant. I kept up my medical marijuana card even though it's too expensive and the side effects make it completely unfeasible. I tried and failed to convince her that this was destroying my quality of life. 

I kept fighting. I had no choice- my life without proper pain management is miserable. I lost the ability to do anything I used to. After another YEAR of being a model patient, patiently bringing up the struggles of living with 9-10/10 pain day in and day out... Today, I won. 

I insisted my mother come to my appointment, because my husband is away with work. I brought it up again, and got the same push back... But finally... Finally, she was willing to listen enough to look up my prescription history and she saw that I had, indeed, been on the same dosage for almost seven years until last August- even reducing my breakthrough medication three times.

247,Severe pressure sensitivity pain,"I’ve always been pressure sensitive, but I’m beginning to feel like this chronic pain in my hips, back, and joints is something more than any of my doctors have considered.

A little history: 

Sickly kid, severe asthma and allergies, and anxiety issues. Fainted often, a couple seizures, no real explanation, terrible reactions to immunizations.

Diagnosed with POTS at 21 after fainting several times in a month period.

Diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer at 24, FOLFOX 29 rounds, Avastin 15 rounds, primary tumor removed March 2018.

During chemo I would have insane nerve pain in my neck, shoulders and arms to about my elbows. It would spike one day before I started feeling better, but my onc couldn’t explain why it happened in those specific areas. It was so bad it hurt to wear a shirt, lay on a pillow, and god forbid someone touch any of that area.

What initially brought me in to my GP (that lead to my cancer dx) was constant back pain. It felt like I had been punched in the middle of my back but just constantly. It may have been tumors pressing on my spine, and they have since shrunk immensely, but I still have the back pain.

Now let’s add on some chronic tendonitis in my wrists, elbows and knees. I also get shooting sciatica pains, and burning in my lower left hip. My hips are insanely pressure sensitive.

My new GP started me on Amitriptyline 50mg to see if it helped. It did!

Then I got a cold while on vacation and the nerve pain my my legs/hips/back/shoulders/neck got so bad that it hurt to sit on a toilet even. Since I’ve been back I feel like I’ve regressed significantly. 

My GP has suggested maybe it’s fibromyalgia, as I do have a family history of it. I’m just not entirely sure what to do next, I don’t know anyone that has been through this, and I’m not sure where to look for more information because all of my health problem kind of compound.

258,It all started with mopping.,"I've had mild to moderate back pain for 4 years with no diagnosis other than back pain. It started shortly after I fell onto my back while mopping tile and broke my arm, but I don't know if that event is related. It flared up in December and gradually got worse. On 5/10, I started having pain and weakness in one or both thighs that hasn't gone away. Sometimes stabbing, sometimes just throbbing. A few days prior to this, I tried yoga and pulled a muscle in my butt. Related? Don't know. On 7/25, my back pain suddenly became severe. Across my low pack and sometimes hips, dull all the time and sharp upon any kind of movement. I have trouble walking or really doing anything. It was 2 days after I rode a few rollercoasters at the fair. Not sure if that's related to my pain either. It hasn't gotten better. Pain takes up every corner of my brain every minute of every day. I can't get used to it. It takes all of my energy to keep working full time and taking care of my 5 kids (by myself). 

So far this year I've tried facet point injections, trigger point injections, muscle relaxers, nsaids, physical therapy, and a chiropractor. I've also lost 40 lbs in an effort to help relieve my pain. The only thing that helped at all was the trigger point injections but they were incredibly painful to receive. I've had X-rays, an EMG, an ultrasound of my leg, and an MRI. The MRI showed a slightly bulging disc on L5 and narrowing foramen. My pain management doctor said this (the disc) is a normal part of the aging process (I'm 33) and that it isn't contributing to my pain. He says my pain is muscular so all he can do is give me muscle relaxers. What does that even mean? I'm trying to navigate this process and coordinate treatment and I feel like I'm getting nowhere. I'm not ready to accept that this is it, that this type of pain is my new normal.

259,Chronic pain survivor ...,,
260,First time post long time reader here,"   I was diagnosed with severe chronic migraines when I was 24 years old. I lived in Dallas, where my general physician generally took care of all of my pain medication needs. He took care of my abortives my pain medication and my medications to reduce the amount of attacks I have per week.

   Recently due to family issues I had to move from Dallas to Austin Texas where the primary physicians down here are Baylor Scott &amp; White. And they will not prescribe me a single thing for my migraines. They told me to go to a pain specialist which recommended that I get a new shot that's not even on the market yet that cost $7,000 per shot and people with migraines as severe as I have have to get up to two shots per month.

    I don't understand why I can't continue the treatment that I had before in Dallas they gave me some sort of life I was able to get out of bed and was able to socialize with my friends I was able to socialize with my family and being a functioning member of society. But here I've seen three or four doctor's two paint specialist a neurologist and my general physician neither of which are willing prescribe anything that my doctors in Dallas for prescribing me that we're giving me some sort of life. But here I spend five to six days a week in bed suffering and pain because I cannot get the medication I need I'm at my Wit's End and I can't find anybody that's willing to help me.

    I was hoping that someone from the community could help me find a solution I have very little help right now that I'll ever be able to get back to the way it was and socialize with my family and get out of bed pain free. I also have a herniated disc in my back which I cannot afford the MRI for that they want to do injections on. They treat me like I'm so sore the drug-seeking addict even though the doctor that was prescribing me my medication is in the same network as the doctor down here even though he can read it on my charge that this doctor has been treating me for almost 20 years for my conditions and yet he still refuses to help me.

    My past posts have been generally about kratom because I've tried that in the past and it didn't really do a whole hell of a lot for me so please do not hold that against me I just want relief and pain relief I want to be able to go out with my family and I want to be able to hold my nieces and nephews again without cringing in pain I want to be able to get out of bed I want to stop suffering and I'm at a loss and I'm hoping somebody here will have some tips or clues or anything that will help me get back to the way I was before.

270,I just want to talk to people who understand,"I am... reluctant to post here as when finding this sub I saw it was being mocked on r/drama but... I feel like the only people to understand how I’m feeling are the people in this sub.

I have severe levoconvex kyphoscoliosis and queried fibromyalgia because of the extensive nerve damage and nerve death in my spine due to the curvature. A rheumatologist (in July this year) diagnosed me with fibro as a footnote on her report and then told me to “get on with my life and try harder, because you’re clearly not trying hard enough.” I exercise as much as I can, I try to eat well and cook even when it’s hard because of my pain. I can’t always stand up because the nerves in my legs don’t always transmit the “stand up” signal. I wake up in pain, I work in pain, I go to bed in pain. And on top of that, I also suffer a LOT with chronic migraines. All of which... was ignored.

Which... as you can imagine is crushing. 

I thought that my doctor was on my side, he at least believed how much pain I was in. Except when I went to him to talk about how bad the rheumatology appointment was he told me he was “sorry I felt insulted” and gave up on me.

So that’s where I am. The painkillers he prescribed aren’t on repeat prescription, so I have a dwindling supply. I just feel completely crushed with no support and nowhere I can go.

274,Even the doctors are just guessing at this point,"Where to begin...

So about 4 years ago, I started getting this nagging pain in both my arms/forearms/wrist. So after about a month of it not going away, I went to my GP and was told I likely have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - fair enough. He suggested icing my wrists, wearing a brace when I sleep, the usual. So like a good patient, I followed instructions and did my best to improve my posture and lifestyle. 

I had just graduated from college, and was offered my first salary job as a technical consultant - basically I'm on a computer anywhere from 8 -12 hours a day, and there's no way to really avoid the amount I'm on the computer, so I would take frequent breaks, and try to stretch as much as possible. 

Fast forward a few years, and now I'm in so much pain it's almost unbearable. I completely stopped using computers except for work, and eventually sought out a physical therapist to help me. To be fair, the physical therapy took me from about a 8/9 on the pain scale, down to about a 4/5 so it definitely helped! However, I'm still not completely healed, and now I'm not sure I'll ever be. 

I continued on with the stretches and routines the PT showed me, and eventually I hit a wall and stopped seeing improvement. I'm afraid with a computer job, I can't truly rest my hands/wrists. 

So this all brought me to seek out an orthopedic doctors - this one specializing in the upper body. We had an MRI done of the test, and to my surprise, he said he saw NOTHING wrong (aside from a few very tiny cysts which I was told would not cause this level of pain). So I'm out about 3,000-4,000 dollars, doing all types of tests, doctor visits, etc. and still can't go through my normal day at work without some type of pain. I've also developed a type of tingling that normally happens when I move around my arm/eblow, and it's a super intense tingling for about 1-2 seconds near the thumb side of my wrist. It's not really painful, but boy does it get my attention. I'm scheduled for the EMG test next week but the fear there is that they're going to say it's going to require surgery, without knowing what the real root cause is. 

If you read through that all, I think you greatly. I just needed some place to put my thoughts, because all my friends and family are tired of hearing about it :( ",
275,Chronic Pain and CPAP?,"Greetings and salutations! 


I've been suffering chronic pain for years. Mostly sciatica, neuropathy, and joint pain, but my doctor doesn't know why. All my Xrays and MRIs and CT scans have been clean. I also suffer from asthma, severe allergies, PTSD, GAD, MDD, and insomnia. As part of my treatment plan, my doctor ordered me a CPAP machine because she noticed I instinctively stop breathing when my pain flares and have a suppressed breathing rhythm as an abuse side effect (from trying to breathe silently to avoid drawing attention) and that's not great for sleep quality. She hopes that better sleep might be more restorative physically and lessen some of my pain and fatigue.

Thank you. ♡",
276,Tizanidine AND Baclofen together?,"Is anyone on a combo of both?

I asked my doctor to try Tizanidine in hopes it might be a better option than the baclofen for my spasticity. My legs have been so bad that I’ve been having trouble getting around. 

Tizanidine 3x a day was a lot, making me so tired and it was definitely dropping my blood pressure. It wasn’t lasting me an entire 24hrs, which I just read isn’t unusual, so when the pain came back it was BAD. In desperation I grabbed the baclofen to try to regulate everything again and started just taking the Tizanidine only at bedtime. I’m suddenly doing AMAZING! I haven’t felt this good in such a long time. 

It’s only been about 2 days on this combo and I need to call the doctor to make sure it’s OK that switched things up the way I did. 

Is anyone else on a combo of both meds? I know they are both muscle relaxers so it is a bit redundant.

278,Weird full body hot flash/flush feeling,"Oh boy...where to begin.  About 1.5 years ago I went from a relatively healthy 30 year old to to a bit of a hot mess. I've always had Generalized Anxiety Disorder but managed fairly well with meds and occasional therapy.

Then I hurt my back, l5s1 herniation annular tear, parts defects etc...then I developed pretty severe tinnitus. Oh boy.

I've managed pretty well after initially being almost incapacitated with nerve pain in both legs and ringing ears all day long. For the last 5 months or so I've been relatively pain free. Back felt fragile but maybe 1 or 2 out of 10 on the pain scale.

 Recently I've been a little stressed from work and noticed that my throat felt tight and had the globus sensation, then I noticed my nerve pain in my legs coming back...and now my whole body feels weird. It feels like I'm having hot flashes in my neck, arms and legs.  Surprisingly I'm not panicking, I feel pretty calm but still concerned and a little upset my trending upwards has now moved downwards.

My doctor never seems very concerned and suggested maybe I go off cipralex and try zoloft (a drug I used in my early 20s with success). I'm starting to really hate my body haha...I didnt do anything to hurt my back again and it feels generally fine so I have no idea why the leg pain came back. And the only time I've felt like full body flush feeling before was when I originally hurt my back and was losing it with 3 or 4 panic attacks a day.

280,Maybe you guys can help me out? Shoulder pain...,"
So I have had pain in my right shoulder for at least two years. I attempted to go to an orthopedic surgeon last year and he kind of blew off my concerns/pain and it made me mad so I sat with the pain for a while longer until I finally couldn’t stand it any longer.
I tried a new office this year in may. I made my appointment got x-rays and and mri right up front which I was extremely happy for and excited an office was taking me seriously. The x-Ray was normal from a medical standpoint the only thing mentioned was that my clavicle was a little close to my joint. The mri was said to be “clean” when the nurse practitioner read it and I was sent to pt. 

Physical therapy did not work I was always sore after and ended up taking home exercises so I didn’t have to keep spending time and money on it.  I got my first cortisone shot in June because the pain was not subsiding with Pt. The shot lasted maybe 2 1/2 - 3 weeks then completely wore off. I went to my next appt my np basically said he didn’t know what to do with me anymore and sent me to the orthopedic surgeon for an appt. My next appt which was about 7 weeks from when I got my first shot, I saw the dr and he read my mri to me. He said that I had tendinitis abd arthritis in my shoulder (which no one ever told me before) and that I need to keep getting injections and it should clear up. Also said I need to take joint supplements that cost $90 for 60 pills which is absolutely insane to me and actually made me a little mad. 

The thing is that I’m two weeks out exactly from my second shot and it has worn off already. I’m confused on what to do, nothing seems to help and I’m worried that continuously getting injections will deteriorate my shoulder more. I feel that since I’m so young drs are not taking my pain seriously. It is very debilitating and if I walk around for an hour I am in so much pain. Should I see another dr? Am I being ridiculous? Do I just need to wait it out with them? It seems that surgery isn’t an option here but I wish it was because I just want it fixed already. Any insight/suggestions are welcome. Thanks for reading.

I have a feeling that since I’m so young (23) drs are more likely to dismiss my pain especially since I didn’t have anything traumatic happen to me and it’s sooo annoying. I posted this in ask docs and only got one response so I’m wondering if any of you have had any experience with this and what I should do? This is something that affects my daily life and ability to find jobs.

My other diagnosis' include PTSD, severe anxious distress, BPD, depression, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and GERD.  I know a good amount of those don't qualify for SSDI, but some do.  I have no issue with working if I find the right job, however, my current job feels like it's literally going to shorten my life.

I also suffer from anxiety pretty bad. I'm in counseling but I probably need medication to control my panic attacks and help me though the day. The counseling helps but not enough. Also affecting my job.

I'm worried that if I get the anxiety medication I need, they won't give me the pain meds I need because they might think I'm abusing one or the other. Am I overthinking this? I think I should ask for the pain meds first so that it won't be an issue, but every time I get ready to call, I become terrified and hang up. I dont want her to think I'm some kind of junkie.

Do you think they would withhold pain meds because of anxiety meds? Or vice versa?

I posted this here because I really wanted advice without judgement. You guys are so great and not condescending at all. Thanks for wonderful advice. I'll look into these suggestions.

Second edit:

Sometime this year I was told I am hypermobile and that I have PFPS (patellofemural pain syndrome). Which sounds a lot more serious than it is, in my opinion. Basically, my knees hurt. They hurt when I walk long distances, or short on bad days. They sometimes hurt when I’m laying down or sitting. I have braces that I wear when (I don’t know whether) I’ll be walking for a long amount of time. 

It frustrates me. So much. I feel like it’s an excuse, like I’m over exaggerating, or being over dramatic. “My knees hurt, I need to sit” “I can’t, my knees can’t take it”. And they do. They hurt. There’s no damage, just pain.

I read things about EDS and arthritis and I feel like a faker. I know it’s stupid and the pain I feel is real, so I’m not faking it but sometimes late at night I think about how I’d rather something was actually physically wrong because then at least it wouldn’t feel like I’m making up excuses. I spent hours looking up symptoms, hoping it’s something else, and then feeling ridiculous because people actually suffer from those things every day.

After a few weeks I told him I could not focus at work and I needed to try something else. He put me on one hydrocodone every 24 hours. I was so sick all weekend hot and cold, anxiety, diarrhea, anger and unable to sleep. It was miserable. I don't know my pain medications but that was rough. I don't want to go through that again but need suggestions. He now wants to give me patches? Thoughts? Will I have opioid withdrawals on all of these medications? Is there something that might help with my pain but not cause withdrawals later once in done? Any ideas on what might not cause such head fuzziness yet still give me some relief?",

303,"Sometimes, I forget (random)","(This is random thrown together thoughts about being a chronic pain patient and a pet owner)

I'm not sure who will see this, but I think we've all been so stressed out that we forget to take our meds. 

I am one of us lucky few who don't need pain meds constantly. However, if I miss just one dose of my nightly preventative medications, I'm down and out the next day. Today, will be one of those days where I'm going to want to sit in bed and take my rescue medications. But instead, I will be out. I will power through anything my body decides to throw at me.

Why? Because my cat, who is the most amazing thing that has happened to me since getting married. My little man has been fighting for his life for 2 days now and will be getting surgery later today. If this, 17lb ball of fur, can make it this far, **NOTHING** will stop me from getting the care he needs. He is fighting to stay alive, because he knows that everything will be okay if he can just hold on.

This cat is my emotional support animal. He cuddles me when I'm feeling down. When I have a migraine and need a quiet place to relax, he will curl up next to me and purr like there's no tomorrow. 

Sometimes, I forget that I can stand up for myself the way I stand up for my cat. Sometimes, I forget to take care of myself. 

I will always be in my little man's corner, just like he is always in mine.



I am so sorry for the jumbled mess up there. I needed to get this off my chest and wasn't really sure where to post this. I know that some of you out there will understand how I am feeling. That even though I am a chronic pain patient, I can still be the pet owner every animal deserves. Someone who loves you unconditionally, no strings, no stipulations, nothing but pure love to keep us going.

310,Hip pain after spinal fusion,I had a spinal fusion on my L5/S1  about 10- 11 weeks in now and have started getting hip pain. It feels like someone needs to kick me in the left hip to get it back in place. There is a constant pulling feeling. Has anyone else had this problem? I go back in a few days to see one of the surgeons as they said I should be feeling better by now. My back pain is nearly gone. It only hurts when I come back up from bending over to pick something up and first sitting down at the end of the day. ,
311,Hope its okay if I post here,"Hi there! Ive had chronic pain for a few years, but its only been unbearble since...Aprilish. anyway, no one could figure it out for the longest time and I was sent to PT for muscle problems. The PT made me do lots of exercises where he moved and lifted my arm and id be a blubbering mess when i got to my car. But PT takes time they said, even though I kept saying it kept getting worse. 

So i finally went back to the urgent care for the 80th time (because my pcp couldn't fit me in for two weeks and canceled on me last minute), got a doctor there that listened (i think bursting into tears when she lightly touched my skin helped, because, pain), and I got referred to a specalist and a PCP. 

So between those two guys, they made a (tentative, though the least scary) diagnosis of TOS-thoracic outlet syndrome. So instead of having PT on my muscles, im having it on my spine starting Wednesday. I havent been able to find much literature on TOS, and the ones i have found are from decades ago. Im not sure if im not looking in the right spot or what. Anyway, today I had my first talk with my pcp a bit more about it: he said it would most likely be chronic. Hopefully pt would help relieve some of the pain. And i could use those exercises when it flares up. 

But guys. It hurts. Bad. I cant shower unassisted. I cant work atm. desk jobs make it flare up ie moving my shoulder from the mouse to the keyboard. If i lay perfectly still in bed and dont move, and the stars are aligned in the house of jupiter or mars or cthulu, it subsides to a dull ache. I don't like taking narcotics because ya girl has an addicitve personality and i feel like trash when i come off of them. 

Anyway, thanks for reading my wall of text. Again, i hope its okay i post here. I know TOS isnt as scary as it couldve been. But it still hurts. A fucking lot. Like worst pain ive felt and ive had someome shove a needle into an infected abcess on my foot. 

Also im sorry for any spelling errors. My autocorrect has decided to take a vacation. 

Also again, i dont know a ton about TOS atm. Im not sure if theres not much, or my googling skills suck, but i cant find much out there. I go back to meet with my pcp in a few weeks, and hopefully they will give me a for sure diagnosis.",

I've been on opiates for a very long time, I've recently tapered way down. I don't feel ready to have none... I have Crohns, osteoporosis, spine fractures, and more... Yet they expect me to just stop.

I see a new pcp end of the month, but I've been assured they won't rx pain meds anymore.

I feel so bad for all of us with legit issues... I feel like we are a victim of all these addicts. Not hating on them, they have issues too. But now we are just told, deal with it.

319,Should I do an injection for my pain?,"Hello everyone here at r/ChronicPain

I just wanted to say it's helped a lot finding a sub with lots of people struggling with similar issues. It's made me feel less alone. I asked a question a few days ago on if pain management specialists seem to always push injections. And the consensus seems to be that yes, they do, and it will usually be the first form of treatment.

Now, I have another question:

I'll just try to summarize. 

I will be going to a pain management specialist soon, as referred to by a neurosurgeon. 

Every single pain management doctor in my area focuses on performing injections for pain. It will be difficult to get medication prescribed I'm sure. At least actual pain medication. I've already tried flexeril and meloxicam and no effects. I've also tried kratom, and cbd and no effects at all either. To be quite honest, if kratom had no effect on me at all, then I doubt pain medication would do anything for me. Physical therapy has also done nothing for me. 

So, injections seems like the only option as I was told I don't qualify for surgery. 

Do you guys think it would be worth it? Or is it too risky? I'm so paranoid since it's not FDA approved, and people saying that steroids should not be injected into your back and all the risks like paralysis, death, and this one condition that can develop that would make it worse...I forget what it's called. 

Should I try it just once? Or just avoid it all together? 

\-----------------------------------------

And as for what my chronic issue is, it's chronic upper back and neck stiffness which turns to pain if I don't crack these areas. Though it is slowly traveling down my middle back now. I crack my neck and back every 2-3 minutes. If I don't, the stiffness becomes so uncomfortable and turns into sharp pain. 

I've had MRI's, x-rays, CT scans since I was a child up until now. They always came clean. Only saying I have scoliosis. (and told scoliosis shouldn't be a problem). I had about several of these done spread over from age 11-25. 

My recent one finally shows something. That I have some bulging discs and some minor desiccation in my neck. But nothing else. It explains why the pain has felt worse, but doesn't explain why I had pain in the first place. Because, again, it started at age 12 and was a 8 on the pain scale up until 6 months ago where it's turned into a 10 on the pain scale. And I was told by the neurosurgeon (the first dr to actually tell me this), that my scoliosis, can cause me pain and discomfort. Unlike how other drs in the past told me it couldn't. 

Anyone have this issue? It's horrible. I can't go to movies anymore since I'm chronically cracking every few minutes or else I'd be in major pain and discomfort. It's hard sitting at my desk at work. Since I constantly have to get up to crack everything. Driving is probably the worst. I'm never comfortable driving. And it's hard to try and crack these parts of my body without crashing. But if I don't, the pain becomes so unbearable, so I'm always at risk. ",
320,Certain Noise makes me faint,"I'm not sure what it is, but it's like dropping a hanger in the room above me, where the sound is that which is in the room I am in, the sound and frequency tends to cause me to faint, I'll hear sound dropping, like ""karroooooon"" my vision goes hot white, then sound will speed back up like everything normalizing at once and loudly.

326,Success with a topical pain cream for sciatica!,"So my ND proscribed a compounded pain cream for my sciatica as a boost to my Oxycodone (trying to keep my dose low). 

The original formula had Diclofenac in it which I had an unacceptable side effect from...high BP and headache. The pharmacist was surprised that I had a reaction to a topical, I tend to be sensitive to medicine. I also got the dry mouth from the Flexeril.

The next formulation I stripped down to essentials, the pharmacist had recommended 10% Ketamine as a  good nerve pain agent. She originally wondered why I left out the standard Neurontin, I won't take the medication for any reason, I would rather stay in pain than risk it.

In any case, just wanted to let the community know that I  have had good success with this formulation. I get a bit of a mood boost as well as a bump to opiate effectiveness. I am only using about two pea sized dollops, maybe 3 at a time (less than one full pump which equates to 1 gram).

Active ingredients are 10% Ketamine, 5% Orphenadrine, 10% DMSO (for deep absorption), Menthol 1%, Tetracaine 2%.

They have the ability to compound a wide variety of medications, feel free to PM me if you are interested. Pretty sure they do mail-order nationwide, they certainly do so in the Northwest (they are located in Portland, Oregon).

327,"A year without answers. Pain that started in neck, shoulder, and now eye as well"," Hello everyone, I'm posting this on behalf of my wife, who is 31.

A quick backstory, this all started about a year ago. My wife decided to obtain a yoga teacher certification, this involved 200 hours of intense yoga training, some days of which were many hours straight of doing practices. A couple weeks in, she mentioned there were issues doing side plank poses, and that pain radiated up her arm. Around this same time we also were going to the gym together, so I had her do some lighter weight lifting (just the bar). She complained that after doing some of the more heavy lifting, she felt a little dizzy, and it started to hurt her neck more, so we stopped that.

As the months went on, her shoulder/neck pains gradually increased. Her trap muscles are very tight and tender, and are full of knots. The pain radiates up her neck muscles, like the SCM. She has inner ear pains, and often says she's dizzy. Unable to walk for more than 30 minutes without needing to rest.

She has been to: Chiropractor, ENT, Orthopedics, Physical Therapist, Acupuncturist, Neurologist and Physiotherapist

Bloodwork has been done, only thing was very low Vitamin D, which she's been on a high dose supplement now for 2 months.

Recently she has had MRI's done on the cervical spine, the spine results showed minor narrowing, but everything else appeared normal per the Doctor.

Just last weekend she had an MRI done on her head, which we were sure would give some indication to everything she has been feeling in her head with the pulling sensation and dizziness. The hospital notes stated, ""The ventricles are of normal size and configuration. There is no shift of midline structures, mass-effect, acute ischemia or evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. No abnormal enhancement is noted. Cerebellar tonsils extend approximately 1 mm below foramen magnum. Absence of A1 segment of right anterior cerebral artery is noted. This can be a normal variant.""

Our doc didn't seem too worried about this and the neurologist said she passed all neurological tests.

Two times Fibromyalgia was brought up to her. Once at a spinal doc who reviewed her spinal results, and another time when we were in India while visiting her family, and we went to see a doctor there since we could get in right away and it was very little cost. We were actually surprised the doc in India mentioned Fibro as well since that didn't seem to be all that common there. But since her symptoms are specific to that area we really don't believe it's that either.

I honestly can't believe it's taken so long and we have very little to go by. Something more recent now is her right eye has been closing and she can feel this pulling sensation on that side of the head too. It doesn't look swollen, but something is physically wrong and we haven't had any solid thing to go by yet. She's waking up in the middle of the night crying from the pain, I feel horrible for her.

Thank you for any ideas or assistance!",

I am lucky to be on medication that is making a big improvement. My pain is not as debilitating as it was, and I am very grateful for that. 
So, just some thoughts ....
Before everything hurt, my movements were largely automatic.  Like, my brain would decide to, say, pick up something that I dropped, or reach out to open the cabinet door to get a glass or whatever. 
I didn’t have to tell my hand to move, or my knees to bend. 
Now, every movement is a choice; is the cost (pain) worth the reward?  It’s not a huge choice, usually. But there is that split second of thought before I reach to pick up my coffee cup, or to turn my head to look out of the window. 
It’s not a huge choice, nor is my pain from doing this type of thing huge. 
But it is exhausting to spend all my waking hours making these tiny choices.  This, in addition the the big choices resulting in greater pain, like vacuuming, or attempting a walk, or shopping. 
I haven’t tried to share this with anyone before because I think it sounds kind of crazy, or like I’m just weak or lazy.

I had brought up a medicinal marijuana card to my pain doctor in the past- but she was pretty against it. Which is why to my surprise when I brought it up recently she agreed! I have to dramatically decrease my dosage before I can get my card and was super worried how my body would take it. 
Surprise,  it didn’t take it well! I called and pleaded with the doctor’s office for help or ideas for dealing the increased pain and horrific withdrawal symptoms, yet the doctor always seemed to be out of the office! Finally I got an appointment- a week later. After a $40 copay she told me about a detox program at a hospital and gave me the info- literally a 2 minute visit. I called that day and was ready to be admitted into the program that night! However, I get a call back about two hours later from the program counselor asking a few questions, which ultimately ended in her saying, “It’s not a good fit.” Apparently, to go through these detox programs you have to be mentally addicted- they don’t care about your physical addiction problem! And since I would be getting the marijuana card, I couldn’t speak to a life of sobriety that they preached. They suggested I find a soboxone Dr. and go from there....It’s been 5 days now, after repeated attempts to get my doctor’s help in finding another program or a doctor that can help me- I’ve been completely shut out! It’s interesting how these doctors sure love to throw medicine after medicine at you, but once you’re ready to get off and try something new- they’re not, “set up for that”, what?! I have always been an advocate for responsible opioid use- as sometimes there just aren’t other available options that help, but I am really upset that there is nothing set up in a pain management clinic to safely detox you from these strong medicines.

They are younger in average, have more money on average;  guaranteed repeat customers. There is also a great deal of profit to be had by detox centers and the companies that make suboxone and such. They also have a chance to recover into fully functioning, contributing members of society, which most of us do not.

Chronic pain patients are often older and in more poverty. Social security disability doesn't give enough to pay rent, let alone non vital needs. More of our lives depend on government support, including getting our prescriptions paid for by medicaid programs instead of paying full price. The healthcare we require as a group means all of us will be more expensive to care for and keep alive. 

**This is all about money, and our government has decided to unleash a passive genocide on us to get rid of the people who cost the government money.**

#Us.

These opiate overrestrictions are a direct, intentional threat to our survival. For greed money for people who are already excessively wealthy. 

We are being killed, but not so that many others may be saved.  but so that very few others can get one more optional upgrade added to their fifth brand new Ferrari. 

Let that sink in. Think of all the pain and suffering and loss our community has sustained and continues to try to endure each day.  It's all for a couple of rich assholes who thinks their upgraded solid gold hood ornament is worth torturing and killing hundreds of thousands of innocent, vulnerable people.

War has been declared against us. Will we die or will we fight for a chance to live? Are we really just going to let ourselves be exterminated like this?

As far as who holds primary responsibility for directing this entire national campaign against our survival, and for creating the various pieces of legislation that got us into this situation, I'm not sure yet, as I haven't caught up with that particular research. (Comment if you know?) 

But what it all comes down to is best summed up by altering a favorite quote of mine by Utah Phillips. 

She said, “The earth is not dying, it is being killed, and those who are killing it have names and addresses.”

And so it is, that
#Patients with chronic pain are not dying, we are being killed, and those who are killing us have names and addresses.

Time may seem late for many of us, but we do not really lose our capability to do great things until after the moment of our death.

344,“You’re too young for that!” ...cool...,"Warning: Long ranty type thing!

I’m a 33 year old female disabled Veteran. I was medically discharged at 24 for non-combat related but service-connected injury relating to a fall under massive weight and then running on it for a year. (‘Officially’ non-specific knee pain because the Army is weird)

I’ve been out for 8 years and I STILL don’t have a real diagnosis, even the nerve damage results from my first NCS aren’t in my VA file because my last duty station apparently didn’t “do” electronic records. (Dx’d as peroneal nerve damage due to crush injury I was told there was nothing to be done about it)

I have classic nerve pain symptoms, restless leg symptoms, low back pain and classic foot drop. Muscle fatigue from washing my hair or mixing up a salad, sleep phases all jacked up, constantly exhausted and brain foggy (finally got an ADHD diagnosis and working on those meds finally something goes right) Hip joint “cracking”, instability, dull aches and shearing pain is the “newest” development in the past year or so.  There are days where I can barely walk because my legs feel like they are in a hell vice, my knee likes to buckle if it’s just tapped the wrong way, and sitting OR standing for more than 20 minutes puts me in tears. Driving is... challenging. I bought a cane because I can’t stand limping. 

Every time I “get” to break in a new Resident (get new ones every two years or so, not including when they randomly reassign me) it’s the same thing: “wow, you’re so young to have so many symptoms!” “You’re not old enough to be experiencing that kind of pain!” “Typically we don’t find those kinds of problems until someone is quite a bit older, so there’s no use testing for that.” Look, Dr. Cheap Labcoat, Id much rather be gainfully employed, or succeeding in college, or even just be able to go for a hike once and a while and not fear plane rides. My standard reply to “You’re too young!” is “Yup! I completely agree, and yet here’s my reality!”

I’m not even looking for opiates, though I’m stamped a drug seeker in my file. Vicodin, Fentanyl, Percocet, all of those make me violently ill. I once begged in the midst of a flare for a Rx of 3-5 pills, because there are times the pain relief is worth the 24 hours of acute stomach pain and vomiting. 

Everything I ask for is discounted, and I swear they assume any “research” I’ve done has been off of the more hyperbolic pages of WebMD. I get that docs are skeptical when patients claim they do their own research, but there has to be a way of recognizing “but what about juice cleanses and magnets?!” And “this article talks about this unusual but fairly distinctive chronic injury can cause these symptoms so can we look into that?” I pay to read actual medical and surgical studies. I follow the newest info on new pain medications. I learned the anatomy of the entire pelvis. Why get so defensive when I suggest what I might think is wrong?  But I guess a CT scan or contrast MRI of my hip to look specifically for a torn labrum isn’t indicated because the x-ray came up clean.

I asked them to inject my hip joint with lidocaine to test for torn ligaments and tissues. Asking for that apparently kick started their “maybe she’s not just a hysterical chick” thinking, but I might just be overly hopeful. 

Eat 4g of acetaminophen a day, lose weight and exercise (but stop if it hurts/stare blankly when I ask about what happens if everything hurts), lower stress and did you try meditating is my current Rx.  You’re probably just depressed and anxious and you have a Dx of mental illness already so you’re their problem. 

The truly shitty part of all of this is that scans that I have had (knee MRI, back MRI, x-rays) come back clean or “acceptable” levels of variance. Since I’m being compared with amputees and 90 y/o Vets, my hitched gait, variable intensity foot drop, and painful yet “successful” passive flexibility means I’m fine. 

I know this is a huge long ranting ramble, and I’m sorry for that, but fucking hell I never get to tell this story because I look fine and my support system gets really tired of my always complaining about being in pain. I don’t even know how to proceed and during really bad days, I fantasize about smashing my joints with a hammer just to finally have something tangible to point to to prove my pain is real.

I didn't realize until shortly after the conversation that I had clearly scared the crap out of him, ""clearly"" being the weird bit because I definitely noticed in the moment but was too obsessed with my pain experience to be able to stop, and he hasn't talked with me since.

Also I'm realizing the pain is turning me potentially into an alcoholic since I've tried everything I would consider ""cleaner"" to no avail.  This has been since this cousin thing, not as a result of just want to make it clear that wasn't due to drugs or alcohol.  Anyway I know this is probably lightweight by standards but I had five shots and three beers within two hours and it let me walk around feeling good.  Which is dangerous to know works.",

Then later it radiates to my chest and it’s exactly in the bottom of my chest at the center which makes it harder to take deep breathes.

I feel so frustrated. Can't get a regular job, can't draw disability because I was a stay at home mother for too long before my injury.

But money is tight; I bring in very little myself (hopefully things will pick up before the holidays). 


I feel like a burden. I feel overwhelmed. And it's so stupid because I bought underwear for my husband earlier in the week and had zero guilt about that, because it isn't for *ME*.  Bleah.

Recently I went back in to said office to get spinal injections and the doctor spoke to me over the phone and explained why I was being tested. At this point I was suffering severe withdrawals and needed the medicine  to even function. I explained that the opiods are no longer in my system because I have been off them for a week. She said I could get tested that day even if it isn't in my system and finally have my painkillers. I agreed.

The attending nurse for the injections told me she did not have time to drug test me and to either stay in their office until 3pm, ( it was 10am at that point) or wait until the next day and come back. 

So, I called the next day and they told me no one is in the office and to wait until the coming Monday.

I've now almost been two weeks off Lyrica and vicoprofen and I'm legit so fucking depressed. I am in so much goddamn pain I can't even leave my bed unless I get high as hell and even then I can only play some overwatch or do a bit of sewing until the pain puts me back in bed. 

I was planning on having a productive and healing medical leave and return to work actually able to do my job , but now I am despairing. I know a lot of it is my fault but I just wanted to rant.

So i have to be in a sling and just not use my arm for a week solid before it quits hurting.

Ibuprofen barely helps at all. Gabapentin only barely takes the edge off. I can barely move my fingers (and it hurts like hell when i do). It's been like this for *over a decade* and no one can tell me what's wrong. If I wasn't left handed I'd never be able to work.

Also somehow all of my problems are on my right side (same as my mom somehow?). My right eye is my bad eye, when I had to have infected teeth pulled they were on the right, my right shoulder is the bad one, my righr hip and knee are the one's always going out on me.

362,Do you ever have trouble with a doctor believing you?,"Hey.

I’ve had a rough day. My last doctor quit without notice two months ago. I had been seeing her for more than a year, and she was the best doctor I’ve ever had. But she was also like 80 years old. 

So, she quit. But the last time I saw her, she diagnosed me with MS, even though I had a minimal amount of lesions on my spine. 

I started seeing this new doctor, who seems good. He had me do a full spine MRI, which turned up minimal damage. I use to have three herniated disks. They are now bulges, with three other bulges in my neck that I wasn’t aware of. 

The problem is that I have a lot of pain. My left leg is numb or painful more often than not, and I’ve had a few flare-ups that are textbook MS. This new doctor told me to my face that my pain was all psychosomatic today and it crushed me. 

I know my pain is real, but how do I convince a brand new doctor who has none of my medical records? I’m trying to get the records sent over, but my last doctor’s office is in dire need of staff and they haven’t yet done it. This new doctor thinks I am a drug seeker, and that I am basically making shit up. 

Meanwhile, I’m over here living with a highly reduced quality of life, because my pain is so bad. I’m constantly sick, and constantly tired. The last doctor I had was amazing and, while this new doctor is doing a lot of exploratory procedures, he broke the tentative trust between us today by insinuating that I’m making stuff up. 

What do I do? Family and friends have all witnessed moments when I could not walk on my own. I feel so betrayed and depressed right now. I truly want to end my life, because I am so tired of doctors appointments running my life! I’m 30 years old and have nothing to show for, and I have zero quality of life! If a cow or horse is sick beyond repair, you just put it down, right? ",
363,"Ugh, Pharmacy trouble","So, workers comp won't do jack for me, including getting me a new MRI for multiple thoracic protrusions so off to a GP I went. All my specialists have been hounding me telling me ""you need a gp, you need a GP"" everyitme I see them. I moved to a new state a few years ago and just never established since I have a PPO.Found someone close to home, literally .5 miles. Worst doctor office ever but I heard of some ""good reviews"" if you get my drift, and I have been out of meds for years since nobody wants to do anything. 

They do all kinds of random stuff a ""normal"" office doesn't do. Check my breathing through a machine, chest xray, the hell. That's just an Insurance money grab but I didn't care at that point.  Anyway I see the doctor, doesn't know jack about lyme disease or most of my issues. I'm thinking ""yeah yeah, whatever guy, I have spent thousands and thousands on good decent doctors out of pocket at Integrative places, good specialists, I don't need your spchel"" He then hands me a script...

Let me tell you, I had TROUBLE filling this. I read up about people having trouble on here but the last time I had anything was over 3 years ago and it was still more lax... per say.

I already knew CVS was a no go so I went to rite aid. They asked me am if this were the first time I had this particular script filled and  and I said, no, I used to get it in California, however, its been a few years. He attempts to fill it and I come back and he hands it back and says ""Since our computers cant look you up in California, we are treating you as a first timer and we can NOT fill this""... sigh. So I went across the street and filled it at a local 4 location chain pharmacy. Filled with no issues.

I felt shitty yesterday since the dr appointment was in the AM and I have DSPS. Pure hell yesterday and today since it takes me weeks to get back on track.  Also felt like a drug seeker. I just felt like I was doing something wrong. I just couldn't take the pain anymore.

Seeing a specialist 4 hours from home Monday(for lyme disease) that I am paying a lot of money for and he will be writing a referral for a new updated MRI. Time to see if I have thoracic Spinal Stenosis since workers comp sure as hell won't do it. Take Tylenol they say! Sigh...

On a happier note, in the same day I found out my Work Comp Medial Branch Block was approved... for my lumbar bulge.(which I didn't even know I had until 2 months ago).. Not my thoracic stuff. Sigh

I’ve had chronic pain most of the time since. I had surgery back in 2013 L5-S1 fusion and had 2 years nearly pain free. But the pain came back worse, and I now have scar tissue on the nerves. Sciatica in both legs. Degenerative disc disease l2-l4 an retrolisthesis l4-l5. I live a very active life style. Currently on 25mcg fentanyl every 48 hours and Percocet, Tizanadine and Celebrex

1.	Outlook: You must accept it. You can’t let it beat you down. Yes it does suck. But you can’t let it make you hate your life. You have to go, “this is my life and I’m going to make the best of it.”

2.	What to expect from pain meds: I’m going to be on pain meds the rest of my life. NEVER EVER expect that your pain meds are going to make you completely pain free. It’s never going to happen and if you expect it to the next thing you know you will be on super high doses and still in pain. The meds will make it tolerable. Dealing with the lower levels is up to you. Change the way you look at your pain meds. Look at them as time. Time with less pain. 

3.	Ignoring the Pain: We’ve all heard about gate theory and that you can train your mind to ignore the pain, this is usually attached to some new age hippy bullshit about feeling at one with the earth. However there are ways to distract yourself from the pain. Split your focus. I do this by watching TV whenever I am working on the computer. Listening to audiobooks when I’m out working on the farm. I find music isn’t enough, but TV and books make you focus intently. If you can distract your mind with multiple things the pain isn’t is bad. This is what has allowed me to work a desk job for the past 8 years. Find your method, this is easy for me as I am already ADD, but it really helps. I had a job that wouldn’t let me do this once and I was sitting in my chair twitching and ready to cry in pain every day. 

4.	Depression: All the doctors and Physiatrists tell us we are supposed to be depressed. I’ve heard bullshit such as “Well I’d be worried if you weren’t a depressed”. But you can live a life with chronic pain and not be depressed. I have done it my father has done it most of my family has. A day in pain is better than a day in a grave. It may hurt it may be hard. But it’s still life. Revel in it enjoy it. Go do fun things, get laid, Whatever you want to do. Don’t let it hold you back. And surround yourself with people who support you and understand. 

5.	Finding the right medication: It took me a long time to find the medication that worked best for me. I worked with my doctor and told her what wasn’t working. Don’t go to your doctor going. “I need more pills.” Go to them instead and say “This isn’t working, what else can we try.” Opiates aren’t the only thing that can help, Nerve medication, Anti-inflammatory. They can do DNA tests now and see what medications work best on you. As in my case they found that I metabolize some opiates very fast and switched me to changing my patches every 48 hours instead of 72. I went from taking 100 10mg Percocet a month to 50 with this change. Going in and saying “I need more pain pills” is going to make you look like an addict. Work with your doctor. They are there to help, be kind be respectful and above all BE HONEST.

6.	Surgeons are assholes: No it’s not just your surgeon. A lot of them are assholes. I’ve met very few nice ones. But mostly they are a pain to deal with. I had one consult with a surgeon where he walked in and said “I cant help you, Get out” and left. It’s very hard to get a feel for which surgeon is a good one. Do your research read reviews. If you meet a surgeon who is a nice person great, It doesn’t mean he or she Is good at what they do. Research the surgeon as well as the method they are using, as well as the facility. Make them explain the entire surgery and process to you. If they won’t do that they aren’t worth your time. Also surgery is not Guaranteed to fix your pain. In my case it made it better for a few years and now it’s even worse because of the surgery. SURGERY IS THE LAST RESORT

370,Body massage machine go! I need help choosing a massage device to ease up some mystery muscle pain between my shoulder blades,"I busted a vertebra (T7) about 10 years ago.

Two years ago I started getting what my GP calls ""muscle spasms"" during some exercises (e.g. rows).  My physiotherapists and other doctors don't know what to call it.  TL;DR: after some exercises there is pain (7/10 intensity) between my shoulder blades.  It will last until massage/freezing/intramuscular stimulation (i.e. it can last for weeks if I don't address it.)

Yesterday I went to a gym that promised hydromassage, but this turned out to be a lie.  But!  They had high-end massage chairs.  I did rows to excess and then used a massage chair for half an hour and I'm not in any (extra) pain today.

I don't know if I need the full massage chair - it looks like it'll be $2000+ even if I go used - because I only have problems between my shoulder blades.

There are massage cushions for $60 on amazon.ca and they seem pretty well-rated.

Importantly, I need it to be a rough massage, based on my experience with massage with a human.  Gentle does not do.

I do not need any fancy features.  I just need to pummel the hell out of my mid-back, ideally every day for 10 years.

Anyone have any experience or suggestions?

No matter how many times I explain I am unwell and can not cope it makes no difference, in fact it just makes things worse. I have carers helping me in the morning and the whole house is being adapted for disability by the government for me but my family seem to think its a joke or a scam. 

I can not live in such an invalidating environment any more its getting me down too much. Maybe its just time to face the fact that my family sucks and are just utterly feckless.",
377,Do your pain management doctors only focus on giving you injections? And not other types of treatments?,"I visited a neurologist who specialized in spine as a last ditch effort for my chronic pain (I was hoping there could be a surgery done for my chronic back pain), instead he told me he couldn't do surgery bc I don't qualify, and was referred from the neurologist to a couple pain management doctors. He gave me a list to choose from. 

Every single pain doc from the list has a website, and everyone of their websites boast about injections. And says nothing about physical therapy (which I'm currently in, but going to switch to a different PT because the neuro also added some new PT referrals cuz the one I been going to hasn't helped) or medication.

I'm extremely uncomfortable with the idea of doing injections because of potential side effects. Also the fact that they aren't even FDA approved. I'd rather not risk having something injected in me, experience side effects, and have to wait until the injection wears out for them to go away, and who knows when that would be? 

Whereas with medication, I can just stop if I hate the side effects.

Is this how it is for everyone else?

It's just frustrating. And gives me anxiety, because I have trouble standing up for myself in general. (social anxiety). And I don't want to be pressured to do injections. But knowing me, I'd go through with it because I'd be too scared to fight back and say no. 

I understand why doctors are hesitant to even give medications these days for people in pain. But why would the next best thing be something thats not even approved? And can cause further issues? 

I'd rather have surgery than injections, and I'm bummed that I can't even have that option. ",

383,Chronic Groin Pain,"Hi guys!I've been having pain in the hip/groin for over a year now. Pain mostly is in L groin area. 22 year old female.

I've had an MRI, CT scan w/ and without contrast, and Ultrasounds(Pevlic, Abdomen, Transvaginal). Everything comes back normal. I used to weight train and haven't been able to for over a year now. I tried yoga, running biking, stretching. Everything seems to make it worse. I've been pretty sedentary for about a year now. My ortho just started me on PT but I don't start for another month.  I want to go back to living an active lifestyle. It's a constant 24/7 dull ache and aggravated by exercise which pain intensifies. Then after exercise for the next week or so i'll be in sharp pain which hurts to walk. Even when I did relaxation yoga.

I'm desperate for answers, ideas, suggestions. It seems like most places don't take my pain seriously and people don't get it.",
384,Caught in the most frustrating and painful cycle and am at a loss with how to proceed,"So I (21F) have been dealing with a deteriorating arm and shoulder after an injury when I was 15 was not properly cared for. I kept getting told I had a small tear in my in my shoulder (not serious enough to operate), and unusually hypermobile joints. My shoulder specialist and three other surgeons declared me ""inoperable"" for any future surgeries because any operation regarding joint re-stabilization will just stretch back out and cause more nerve discomfort. Fuck me, right. 

Fast forward to the present, It was discovered via MRI that I had a herniated C6 disc in my neck, advanced nerve slowness that is predicted to continue to deteriorate, and a dislocating ulnar nerve. I now have full blown CRPS, peripheral neuropathy, nerve dead patches from my neck down to my hand, two paralyzed fingers stuck in a ""claw hand""  and most annoyingly, I get horriffic dystonic muscle spasms that cause my whole arm to cramp, seize up and curl up into a fist, and rotate in the opposite direction. The muscles pull so hard it feels like my wrist is going to break. Anything can trigger a contraction i.e bumping into something, trying to lift/pull something, if I miss my medication, sleep wrong, drastic temperature change etc.  

Well after trying every possible medication that can help muscle spasms and nerve pain, and two failed nerve blocks, my neurologist suggested trying physical therapy again after I was told by a pain specialist that I should not have any more invasive procedures like injections or nerve blocks and stick to holistic treatments from here on out. I take whatever treatment I am given seriously and even though physical therapy has failed in the past, I'm willing to try again and give it my best shot. 

I'm now starting to have doubts. When I go to my sessions, the physical therapist tries having me do certain exercises to open my hand, and strengthen my VERY unstable wrist joint. But every exercise I do is very painful. Like, internal injury level paunful. Usually within the first few minutes of each session I start to cramp up into a dystonic spasm. The more I move, the more intense it tightens. Every effort made to strengthen my wrist, elbow, and shoulder, seems to aggravate everything more. I end up in tears at the end of every session, and my arm swells and turns this sickly purple/grey color and is very cold to the touch, but feels like it's on fire and being stabbed with pins and needles. My roommate doesn't let me drive myself to the sessions anymore, because I can't drive myself home with a seriously contorted arm and I have gotten stranded many times because once I am in a contraction, there is very little I can do, except stay calm and wait it out. 

 I can tell my Physical therapist is perplexed by my case and even googled my symptoms to try and figure out how to proceed, bless his heart. He seemed visibly upset when I explained my medical history and lack of care and concern on my previous doctors' part.  In his words, he has no idea how things advanced this far without any kind of intervention and how did these specialists overlook so much? He actually excused himself to another room when I brought up that one doctor said my symptoms were coming from my head due to undiagnosed bipolar schizophrenia, and other doctors straight up accused me of faking for attention and drug seeking. I appreciated his empathy, but his emotional response was a bit uncomfortable and awkward for me. 

Right now I am on the fence about proceeding with my physical therapy routine. I always seem to come out in a worse state than when I check in. The main reason my wrist is so unstable is due to how hard the contractions pull it from the joint and how long it stays stuck thst way (sometimes takes hours or days for a spasm to pass). I go into physical therapy to help strengthen the joint, but the exercises trigger a spasm, which pulls my wrist out of the joint and makes it more unstable and harder to work with.

 Yesterday was what really made me question if this is worth it. I was already sore from my previous appointment last week, and not thrilled about going back. I had been struggling with pain management and functionality all week, and expressed that to the physician. I was already partially in spasm when I came in. I ended up dislocating my wrist trying to use one of the therapy tools early into the session. I was a crying mess the whole time, and my arm hurts worse than it has in months. 

I'm very frustrated by this cycle. I try to do the exercises to strengthen my arm, but the more I move it the faster I go into spasm, which undoes any of the strength training I just did. I was already told on my initial consult with the head of the PT office, that they are not ""miracle workers"" and ""they cannot confidently say if the therapy will help me improve or not but we can try, as long as I don't expect noticable results"". 

I have accepted that I have to live with this. It won't heal. I am disabled and that is okay with me. But Im concerned about my quality of life. Ive spent this entire past year mostly in pain trying to improve my position. But i just want to enjoy my 20s and not have to deal with my family seeing me suffer all the time. When do I say enough is enough? I will not ever give up hope that I can live a happy, functional life with this condition, but the more to focus on it the worse it seems to get. 

I feel caught in a viscous cycle and I just hage a bad gut feeling. I don't know where to go from here. 


Tldr; muscle spasm stretched out the ligaments and tendons in my wrist to the point it can't stabilize itself anymore. Pt to help muscle strength triggers the spasm which stretches the joint and undoes all the work I just did. Frustrated, in pain, lost.

385,Hospital Bed Recommendation for My Grandpa and his Spine,"My 89 year old grandfather is newly bedridden because of excruciating pain in his lower spine. They’ve diagnosed stenosis and a litany of other elderly ailments. The only time he is not in 10 out of 10 pain is when he is laying down, mostly flat on his back. He is currently in a rehab nursing home so that we can try to develop a proper pain management, physical therapy, and general care plan, but we are hoping to bring him home next month. 

Does anyone have recommendations for a comfortable hospital bed that helps prevent bed sores, pressure point problems, and any other adverse issues? 

We are doing our very best to make his last bit of time on earth as painless as possible without knocking him out with drugs, so other tricks and gadget recommendations for keeping him comfortable are also welcome. His mind remains sharp as ever, it’s the body that is giving out. His awareness of his suffering kills me, and I hope we can help him.

So In trying to go through the process of figuring it out again but it takes months to get anywhere. To make it worse I have anixety and one of my triggers is the phone. I literally have to work myself up to make a phonecall which makes the process even tougher. Why can't we have a health system where you get answers in a timely fashion why does it take months rather than weeks, then I get discouraged. Mentally I don't have the persistence to call doctors, insurance and everything again and again for months to try to figure things out.

390,Tramadol 100 mg Extended Release with 50 mg Immediate Release for breakthrough?,"Does anybody have experience with this? Because I have cerebral palsy, I also have chronic pain. I was on 200 mg IR tramadol (4 of the 50 mg pills a day) but my doctor thought it would be easier to take one of the extended release (ER) pills and only take one of the immediate release if I have breakthrough. I can take up to 2 of those. 


I was on the 200 mg IR for years. The 100 mg ER definitely does help, but taking the IR with it gives me this weird nervous energy while somehow making me drowsy, even breaking the IR pill in half. I've been on it a little more than a week now, so maybe I just need to give it time to sort through the side effects.


I'm also just a bit of a hypochondriac and I see things like ""serotonin syndrome"" and ""seizure risk"" and it freaks me out wondering if this combination is safe. Part of me wants to believe if my doctor prescribed it for me, its probably safe, especially since I've been on tramadol 8 years total now, but the effects can be scary.

I'm female, and my pain is within one particular part of my pelvic floor muscle. The past few years it has flared up when I drink alcohol, not every time but almost, more often than not. Lately it's gotten worse. And what's strange about it is it's not after processing the alcohol or anything, it's not dehydration either. I'm talking immediate as in as soon as I swallow my first sip, it reaches my stomach, and the pain starts. It always subsides after about half an hour when I keep drinking, and obviously I like to drink now and again socially though I know the obvious answer is to stop if it hurts. I do because the pain always goes back to it's normal levels non flare-up. My doctors have had no answer for this.  


I would like to know if anyone has an explanation or just shares the symptom, if it is hurting my condition and setting me back I may have to cut out alcohol though I would rather not if I can just live with this temporary discomfort. Thanks for reading.",

409,After seeing so many posts about how the opioid abuse problem effects our treatment I finally get it.,"I read through here often and see post about how us with chronic pain can’t get proper treatment because of the regulations and strict controls put in place due to the rampant abuse. I never really saw it personally up until yesterday. I moved from a big metropolitan area in which I lived in a well off neighborhood. My PCP there had prescribed me Soma in order to sleep. I have a severe hip joint problem that causes me chronic high level pain and by night time I can not get to sleep without something helping me. The place I used to live also had legally available marijuana and I used that throughout the day in order to manage my pain. It worked wonderfully for years and I have never had to take any other pain medication ever other than the Soma to sleep, and even that was only on the really bad nights. I am terrified of addiction and being messed up from pain meds so I’ve always stayed away. 

Now I have moved to a rural area in a southern state. I went for my first appointment at a new PCP yesterday and explained my condition, explained I’ve never wanted or needed medication due to being able to use the marijuana but now that I live somewhere that it’s not even close to legal I am miserable and need something to manage. I explained I take Soma to sleep, which I have needed every night since being here. He told me he hasn’t prescribed Soma in years due to its high abuse factor and that likely my Pain Management doctor would not prescribe it either for the same reason. I was devastated. I asked that even if I’m already taking it and have been for a while now that I wouldn’t be able to get it? He explained that he couldn’t but he could prescribe something instead. He gave me Flexril to replace it. I did a bunch of research into the two and comparing them. Everything I have read says Flexril is horrible. That it clouds your mind and puts you in a fog. I’m terrified of being constantly fucked up and tired and just brought down by medication. 

Does anyone have any experience with Flexril? Any advice on moving from Soma to Flexril? I’m so incredibly frustrated and down about this whole thing. I can’t get medication that I have already been taking because other people abuse it. I have a whole new understanding of all those posts now and I really wish this wasn’t a thing.

410,"The computer glitched, so I get to suffer: American healthcare at its finest","Yesterday was my monthly doctors appointment to refill my pain medication. At the end of the appointment, he sent my script electronically, and we left. My spouse and I housesit/petsit so we had to go wait before picking up my medicine anyway, so I settled in to wait for the pharmacy to text me when it was done.

  -Note- at this point, I'd taken my last pill that morning.

  So after a bit I get a little concerned and call the pharmacy. They never received my prescription. Fuck. I can't directly call the doctor's office, because their phone system is idiotic, but I leave a message that the Rx didn't send. Luckily at this point the pet sitting client returns home, so we're able to update them on the house and animals and drive back to my doctor's office.

  They pull up my chart. 

""Oh, yeah. It shows an error when he tried to send it. Sometimes the system glitches out like this.""

  So since he's already approved it and sent it, it should be easy to just fix the computer error, right? Wrong! The doctor has already left, and because my medicine is a controlled substance, he and only he can fix this computer error. I tell them I'm out of medicine already. I mean, I'm leaning on my spouse and cane pretty hard at this point; I've driven around and stood longer than I had planned for today, and I had planned this thinking I'd have medicine to help me last longer. 

  They tell me I'm SOL, my doctor won't be back in till Wednesday, but they'll ask one of the other doctors in the morning, and *try* to re-send the Rx tomorrow. 

  I couldn't fucking believe it: the Rx had legally and correctly been sent by my doctor, but because of a computer error, I am being forced to stop my meds cold turkey for 2-3 days. Last night was rough. Luckily I had mmj to help me escape my pain a bit. I'm hoping one of the other doctors in the office is willing to fix this shit show so I can get my medicine and actually do more than lying in bed in pain.

419,"Another attempt at ""fixing"" my pain failed, and now I'm feeling depressed.","Yesterday I tried hypnosis as a treatment for my pain. 

The way I was told it works is that even though the injury has healed and nothing is technically wrong anymore, the body and nerves can sometimes remember the pain and therefore still sends signals to the brain that it hurts. Kind of like how some amputees still feel pain or an itch on their amputated limbs. The hypotist  then through hypnosis ""talks"" to your subconscious to ""let it know"" that there is no reason for the body to feel the pain anymore. Or something like that. I'm obviously not an expert on the area, and this is a pretty condensed version of the description I was given. 

I'm generally a sceptic in regards to alternative treatments, but every time I see a doctor or specialist they say that they can't find anything wrong with me, so I thought that maybe, it *was* just a case of my body ""remembering"" the pain, and that it could actually work, since there's apparently ""nothing wrong"". The hypotist had great reviews and a money back guarantee if it didn't work, so I thought that it was at least worth a shot, since there was nothing to lose.

I wanted it to work *so bad*, so bad that by the time I had my appointment I was sure it would. But, it didn't. I'm in just as much pain today as I was before the hypnosis session. And now I'm just depressed and sad. This was the first time in a very long time I've felt any sort of hope in regards to get pain free, and now I've gone back to feeling hopeless.

430,Herniated Disc L4-L5,"I know this is long, but if you read this and reply with anything helpful, you are a saint.

I am 20 years old. 6-2 170 lbs. About 10 months ago I started having pain in my low back. I was a busboy at a restaurant so I assumed it was from that. Over the next couple months the pain worsened. I saw a chiropractor, and after 3 weeks of that, my pain had severely worsened. I decided to stop messing around, went to an orthopedic surgeon, got an MRI and found out I had a herniated disc in the L4-L5 region. I was told a few weeks of physical therapy would bring me back to normal. I did over a month of physical therapy with no improvement. I went back to the orthopedic surgeon, was given a cortisone shot, and once again told that physical therapy would have me back to normal in no time. Every time I saw a therapist or doctor they all pretty much brush me off and say I will be fine in a few weeks. The pain has worsened to the point where I had to quit my job, I am unable to stand for over 5 minutes at a time, and sitting is nearly always painful. I was prescribed a weeks worth of oral steroids. About 2 days pain reduction, then back to normal pain. I am nearly always lying in bed now and I get up and walk when I can. I have been doing the McKenzie method and other stretches suggested by physical therapists every day for the past several months. I recently got an epidural shot which had no effect. I am supposed to leave for college this month and it just amazes me that 10 months ago everyone was saying I would be fine in a few weeks.

The pain is obviously a consistent ache in my low back, but then a more centralized pain lower than that, like 2 inches above the butt crack. Additionally the low back/right buttock area and down the buttock. I feel it 24/7 and it worsens any time I do something that isn't lying down.

I have been prescribed pain meds, gotten shots, taken steroids, sat in hot tubs, iced, done therapy, and nothing helps.

I would say that I am in good shape, and until the pain, I would workout 4-5 days a week and play basketball all the time. I consider(ed) myself to be active and healthy. The past 6 months or so I have been unable to work, workout, even sit through a movie at times. My life consists of waking up, stretching, walking, lying down, more stretching, then sleep. These last few months were supposed to be my sort of last hurrah before I left to go to college. While all my friends have been having a great time, I have been literally lying depressed in bed all summer. I was not even able to get a job to earn some money. I may not even be able to go away to college now. 

I honestly don't know what I expect to get out of this. I needed to rant, I suppose, and anyone who has had a similar situation I would appreciate it if you had any words of wisdom on how you recovered. This injury has made me genuinely depressed as it has cost me tons of money and ruined almost the past year of my life. I received expert opinions and advice and nothing so far has eased the pain. I've honestly never felt worse or at such a low point in my life. Any help on how to recover from this is greatly appreciated. Sorry if I am being dramatic, and if you even read this far, I appreciate you. ",

432,8 years of chronic pain before right diagnos,"Short backstory. I'm a 34 yo male. Ive had chronic pain in groin but mostly lower back for 8-10 years with no clear reason why other the lumbago diagnos. 9 months ago i did a deadlift with really bad form and heard a pop and insane pain. Got xrays but they showed nothing. A few no the later the pain is killing me more then normal. A 9 out of 10. So doctor sends me to MRI. It shows clearly a herniated disc on L4-5.  A month ago I got to see a surgeon for that herniated disc L4-5. We look at the pictures together from MRI. He shows me clearly why I've been in crazy pain and how the nerve is pinched. Then I tell him I've had pain in the other side of my back for 8 years before all this. He shows me again and we can together see that the disc below is also damaged and clearly the cause of my other pain. I get pretty upset and ask how far back can you see that it's been damaged? He starts checking old xrays and MRIs I've done. And from xrays 2010 he shows me that something is going on at s1 disc. I feel the rage fuming. Before this the diagnosis I've had is vague back pain and chronic pain syndrome. Also the 2015 MRI is very clear that my disc is fucked. My doctor didn't say shit about it all these years. She even said. I can train however i want since it's prolly just nerve dmg and nothing dangerous since they couldn't find anything. The shitty thing is I turned my life around 3 years ago when I started doing heavy powerlifting. It got me out of depression and I felt good about me and what I was doing for the first time in years. My surgeon said I literally pulled my other disc to get fucked. Cause I'm strong but my spine isn't. This new herniated disc could 100% been avoided if someone bothered to look at my plates. Of course you are thinking "" why do heavy training when in pain already"" it's simple. It was the o my way I could get calm and get a sense of satisfaction. I feel really bad about it though. And nog the only way to fix it is fusing the spine. It has high risk but I can't live my life with this constant pain. And I also feel really sad I will never lift something heavy again.  During these 8 years I've been through everything. All kinds of doctors, therapy, medicine and different rehab training. Nothing helps. Been so depressed i wanted to kill myself becsuse there was no light in the end of my tunnel. Today my depression is minor due to me having a solid girlfriend that understands and helps me with everything and training to get by every day. I'm scared of surgery. I'm scared of once again having to find new identity if it all goes good. And I guess I have to file a complaint or sue the healthcare. But where do I find the energy for that? If anyone been I the same position please let me know your experiences and tips ect. Thank you for reading my sad rant.  Feel free to ask questions too if I can help in any way. ",

436,"Rant: Herniated Discs, Depression, and ESI treatment...","Hi all,

I don't even really know where to start. I'm a 22F and a week ago I got out of my car and felt the worst pain I've ever felt in my entire life. It felt like I had a two-ton weight crushing my spine and stabbing me at the same time, it radiated all the way from my spine to my hips and down to my toes. I laid in the back of my car and cried for two hours because I couldn't move without feeling every muscle in my body contract. I went to the emergency room where they gave me every drug under the sun and then sent me in for an MRI - long story short, I have a herniation in the L4 and L5. 

The ER doc sent me home with Percocet and steroids and referred me to a specialist. The specialist ended up giving me gabapentin, meloxicam, and methocarbamol and told me she's referring me for epidural steroid injections ASAP because of the severity. I don't really know how severe this is in comparison to other cases to warrant her wanting injections immediately? 

I'm still in some pain but mostly just sore. I did research on ESIs and I'm fucking terrified. I really want to try to heal this with medication and physical therapy before jumping to injections so quickly, especially after hearing a lot of stories of them not working or being potentially dangerous. I'm also afraid of the pain of the injections and potentially jerking during the insertion. 

I'm also overall just discouraged. I already suffer from depression and I can't help but just worry about what this injury means for the rest of my life - I keep reading that a lot of people never function the same way again, that the injections didn't work for them or hurt them, that they deal with pain every day, etc. I find myself crying a lot and worried that this injury is going to define the rest of my life. 

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for by posting here - just felt the need to vent a little bit. I'm sorry if this isn't even the right subreddit, but all of my research on this led me to here.",
437,I need help with options to pursue to help chronic lower back pain when laying down.,"About 7 months ago, I started to have lower back pain while I was sleeping at night. It's gotten steadily worse and now it consistently wakes me up with excruciating pain. I don't have any pain (except residual tenderness leftover from the night) when I'm standing, sitting, walking, etc, just when I lay down. It doesn't seem to matter whether I'm on by back or side (I tend to be a side-sleeper, but I've tried every position I could to find one that's comfortable). I've done the pillow between the legs thing, the pillow under your legs thing while on your back, etc. I don't believe it's our mattress because I travel a lot and in the past few months have slept on over 30 different beds, all gave me the same back pain.

I went to my doctor and he referred me to physical therapy. They have had me do a variety of stretches and muscle strengthening exercises for my back, ham-strings, hip-flexors, and ham-strings. I've been to five physical therapy appointments over the course of a month and haven't noticed any amount of relief. I've also started going to a chiropractor (who took x-rays that didn't show anything unusual) and have also not seen any relief from that either.

Every night I end up taking 800mg of ibuprofen before bed and two tablets of Tylenol during the night, but the pain still forces me up and out of bed by around 4am. I can usually feel the back pain starting almost immediately after laying down. There wasn't any traumatic event in the past year that could have led to the pain that I'm aware of.

After working with the doctor, physical therapy, the chiropractor, and stretching/exercising, I'm starting to run out of ideas of what to do next. I don't want to just accept that this'll just be the way it is from now on, but I honestly don't know what my next step should be.

Does anyone here have advice about what I should look into next to help figure out how to end my back pain?

TL;DR: Lumbar pain when I laid down, PT, Chiro, and stretching hasn't helped...any advice?",

439,Bummer...,"Im doing a lot better than I was doing a couple of years ago. I had spinal stenosis and disc degeneration and had a 2 level fusion. I also had some autoimmune like issues that i didnt have a firm diagnosis for. So after surgery,  I was still struggling with a lot of muscle spasm and also lower back issues that were giving me sciatic nerve pain. I stopped working to get things under control, with no meds and at my pace. I am lucky enough to have a supportive spouse.  Anyway, about 4 months ago i felt ready to dip my toe in the work waters again and took a part time job at what i thought would be a decent place.  I was upfront about my limitations and how if i worked too many hours, i would begin to experience issues, but that i could definitely handle the pace since i had been doing so well.

Things were going pretty good until last week when my manager got injured on the job and i went in to cover for her on my day off. It was the busiest shift id ever worked, and i was working it alone. I got a spasm right over my surgical site c 5~6, 6~7 and instantly got a tension headache all over and felt like the right side of my face was being impacted. I had a couple of moments of dizziness, but no one else was there and we were BUSY so i pushed through to the end of my shift. 

I texted my manager when i got home that day and told her that if i had to work a full week of days like that, I would have to give notice bc it was a lot for me to do alone.  So, she's back at work today and says that she took that as a threat and they are looking to hire a new person. I am confused , because we spoke on the phone that night and i was clear that i could still work the shifts i had been working before and that i planned to work ahead, and she even said that day was a fluke and busier than theyd ever had.  But apparently, they need *reliable* people.  A little later in the conversation when I was trying to explain to her what happened to me during the shift, she cut me off, saying, ""We've heard enough of that.""

I understand the needs of the business being their priority, but it offended me that i was upfront about my limitations and that ive never been anything but on time, worked extra when asked, and when i hit my limit and notify her that it is impacting me like i knew it would, but apparently im not reliable.  Plus, it did hurt my feelings to be cut off like that in the middle of me talking to her.  Another employee was there, and she said something later that evening about people ""being babies"", so i guess that's what they are thinking of me.

Im not old, but im the oldest person there. I told them i could only work so many hours but that i would help the week she was going to be out, but that i would need someone to come in for at least a couple of hours during the peak times. Anyway, it feels like im going to be let go because i cant do more than i told them i could do without it hurting me. This job does not pay that much,  and if i end up back at the doctors, one steroid shot will eat up my whole 2 wks pay.

I just feel like a failure and that i should just hurry up and die so as not to be an inconvenience on capitalism.  I feel like i can still contribute but people do not respect boundaries or health limitations and are all too willing to believe that people are babies, or exaggerating, or whatever.  I just wanted to make a few extra dollars. I know im not as bad off as some people are, and im also not as bad as i was, so i dont want to be ungrateful, lest the universe come smite me.  But damn, im bummed about this.

443,First ketamine infusion,"I’ve just started my first ketamine infusion today. 

150mg over 24 hours via subcutaneous infusion.

Currently not feeling anything but I’m not worried.

Mentally drained though. I’ve spent a long time trying to get someone to hear me out and I’m so glad I’ve found an amazing doctor to go through this with.

I have spinal stenosis, with sciatic nerve pain down my left side.
My pain specialist believes that my pain system is hyperactive, always alert, sending mixed signals.
So we are hoping the ketamine brings it all back under control.
Well that’s my understanding of it.

I’m doing my best to see this as a mini break.

The hospital is almost like a lovely hotel service.

I really hope this works. I’ve been putting on a show for so long, I don’t know how much longer I can keep it up!

12 hour update: I have had my infusion running for roughly 12 hours now. Pain is still there. Only allowed paracetamol as break through, but I am trying my best to avoid breakthrough as I want to focus on my body and healing. I did give the nurse a heart attack when I was laying on the floor a few hours ago doing some stretches (she thought I had fallen over).
One thing that has been changing steadily is my temperature. It’s slowly been rising the last few hours. I now have a temp of 38C. However, I don’t feel warm. So febrile, but asymptomatic.

24 hours: (a little shy of 24 but who’s counting 😉) my pain levels remain pretty high, roughly a 7. Comes and goes in waves. Overnight I found that I was sensitive to light and had a mild headache/pressure in my forehead. I didn’t sleep too well. Doc has just been in to see and he’s doubling my dose. Bottoms up! 

48hrs: yesterday sucked big time. The 300mg/24hours seemed to do nothing for my pain. By 6pm I was in so much pain that I was crying uncontrollably (yes, I know, I should have called someone sooner, but I’m stubborn). I got some good breakthrough relief and I don’t know what they gave me, but it worked like a charm. Today my doctor is putting me up to 500mg/24hrs. Hopefully we start seeing some relief soon!

72hrs: Pain still kicked my ass at the 500mg dose. I had to have much more of my breakthrough pain relief. I’ve asked for a referral to a psych because I thought from day one my pain management would be under control. I had false ideas. Being in here has made me be honest with myself with how much pain I am actually in, and it’s a helluva lot more than I’ve been telling everyone. I know I have chronic pain, but there was always a part of me that hoped I’d have a magic cure. I’ve been doing everything the doctors have told me to do, I’ve lost weight, I do hydrotherapy, I do exercise therapy, I do yoga, meditation, I’ve done everything, and while it helps manage the pain, it’s still there. I thought this was another step to getting rid of this nasty affliction for good. But... it’s not. I need to come to terms with the fact that I can’t get rid of this chronic pain for good, but there are strategies in place to help me manage it.

Sorry for my rambling. Going up to 800mg today. 

96hrs: it seems that 800mg might be the good starting dose for me. I can feel my pain still there but it’s like there is a glass wall around it. It’s hard to describe. When I’m tired I feel somewhat “drunk”. Like tipsy? I will be discharged in 24hrs after another 800mg of ketamine. Likely I’ll be back soon, and straight away I’ll be started on 800mg of ketamine and then even up to 1000mg. He’s upped a few of my regular medications and given me some better immediate release medication as well. I’ll be discharged in 24hrs. 

Day 5.
The last 24hrs are a bit of a blur, 800mg of ketamine had me feeling tipsy, without any other affects usually associated with drinking haha.
I’m glad to be home.
Right now I’m feeling like there is a glass wall still around the pain. We shall see how it goes.
I’m just exhausted.

It's worse in mornings - It's a bit painful getting up but once I stand up, pain completely goes away after few seconds.


I also noticed whenever I do some physical stuff (like shoveling or carrying heavy stuff) - The pain arrives but after few days goes away and next time it doesn't hurt at all (assuming this is like exercise - the more you do it the easier it gets).

445,Too young for the pain (Venting),"I'm an 26 yr old female with Elhers Danlos (Hyper-mobility), Fibromyalgia, Chronic Migraines, and Vertigo. My hips are also crooked (the right is one inch higher than the left) which causes the IT band to pop over my pelvic bone.

I thought my dad's family would understand considering my aunt and cousin both have Elhers as well. However, it seems like they do not believe that I am in as much pain as I say. They both have more knee problems than I do, however my pain is more generalized than that. I have more overall body pain then they do. They are constantly looking down on me for not attending events with them. I've had a talk with my Grandmother, who influences the rest of the family, however it has not helped much. I have a very negative view on them due to the constant harassment of  ""When are you going to get a job?"" ""You went to the ER again?! Why now?"" ""Couldn't you handle it at home with x, y, z over the counter medications?"" Or them just downright telling me that it's all in my head, and that I'm a hypochondriac like my mother (who by the way is NOT a hypochondriac, I have many of the same medical issues as her)  

My biggest problem is that I cannot physically work anywhere. I've been trying to get my doctor to help me start the disability process. But I cannot get a single doc to understand that no company would hire me due to the sheer amount of restrictions or allowances I would need to have a safe working environment. Most of the time, I am met with ""you are too young to have this kind of pain or diagnosis""  which is complete crap!  I am sick of doctors not believing me, in any way. If my hip were to give out on me at work, I would not physically be able to stand up until the pain subsides. If, a migraine were to hit, and my rescue medication doesn't help, then I would have to go to the Emergency Room (ER) to get a migraine cocktail. Also, because of the way my hips are, I cannot stand or sit for more than 1 hour at a time.  Living like this is a nightmare. 

It took almost 13 years to be diagnosed with Chronic Migraines, with multiple visits to the ER, and talking to my primary. I am now, thankfully, on a medication regiment which helps control the migraines (including getting Botox injections). I used to have over 15 migraines a month and am now down to maybe 15 in 3 months! (With the exception of the last few months, due to stress and going to a Pain Management Program, which caused more pain instead of helping decrease it).

My second biggest problem is that not many doctors know what Elhers Danlos is or that it's something that can cause constant pain in the joints. Because of my age, hardly any doctor believes that I have Chronic pain, much less the amount of pain I have. I believe that my records have me labeled as a drug seeker, which is complete and total bullshit! Before we found a migraine cocktail that helps, the only thing that helped get rid of the pain was narcotics. I am always honest with any doctor I see, if that's what worked in the past, then that is what I should get. However, if they want to try something else BEFORE giving me narcotics, I'm all for it as long as in the end, my pain is managed. In the past few months, I was having some trouble with a tear in my muscle wall, my abdominal muscle relaxer didn't give me relief, neither did over the counter medications. I was given one dose of narcotics when I went into the ER, then they ran tests and scans to make sure it wasn't my appendix or gull bladder. Which obviously I'm alright with. However what I'm not okay with is not being given anything for my pain when the previous dose of meds wears off because they ""can't find anything wrong with me"". THEN they try to prescribe something that CAUSES me to have rebound migraines! I was told to suck it up and take the meds so one kind of pain can be controlled. 

I'm just at a loss on what to do when it comes down to it all.  No one understands that the only reason I can manage my pain as well as I do, is because I'm not working, and am home almost all the time. I almost had to get my GED because I failed so many classes in high school due to missing so many days because of the pain I'm in. I graduated just after I turned 20, which in my state (country maybe?) is the cut off of being able to attend a public school. I don't think anyone truly understands how difficult attending school was for me. I missed almost 1/3rd of the school year due to various medical issues. And if school was that hard, how would I be able to work? Where the rules about missing days is more strict?

Sorry for the long winded rant. I just needed to vent! ",
446,Does Anyone Know Anything About Coccyx Pain?,"Hi,

For the past three years I've been struggling with coccyx pain. About a year ago, it started getting much worse, and I'm rapidly losing my ability to function. I miss multiple days of work a week, I can't see friends, I can't do housework, I can't even watch a movie.

I've been under the care of a pain specialist. She has me at the max dose of Gabapentin, but it does nothing. I've had three procedures (ganglion impar blocks) but, once again, they've done nothing.

My doctor just says things like ""don't give up hope!"" despite not offering any help. I have an appointment with her on Wednesday, but I don't think she's going to do anything. I'm scared of trying to find a new doctor, since I've always struggled with finding doctors because they have to meet so many criteria (taking new patients, near where I live, available so I can still work).

The worst part is that my only interactions with my husband now is fighting over the pain and his accusations that, because I can't do most things I used to be able to do, I must just be lazy or something. He's a doctor as well and just refuses to believe that this is a problem. He always takes the pain specialist's side, which is to just do nothing and have me live with the pain forever. He seems to think it will just magically get better one day and, until then, I just need to shut up about it. He doesn't understand that, unless this pain goes away, I'm looking at a life of permanent disability.

Does anyone have any idea how to get through this? Either emotional or some sort of resource on treatments I can get. My doctor just won't make suggestions, so I have to research treatments on my own and beg her to do it.",
447,What to wear to a specialist appointment?,"Hi all,

Thank you so much for this sub, it’s so helpful to know I’m not alone and others can relate. 

So I *finally* did the GP-ortho-ortho surgeon dance and I had to wait two months to get a consult. It’s today and I’m a bit anxious. 

So, kind of dumb question: does anyone wear anything in particular to doctors’ appointments? Do you dress up, dress down, or somewhere in between? I want to make sure I make a good impression while still being comfortable and not putting my spine under any strain. 

Any advice or tips would be helpful. Thanks!",
448,Is this it? Venting,"I'm 24 years old with Ankylosing Spondylitis, Fibromyalgia , and have had chronic pain for the past 4.5 years old my life. Out of those 3, the thing that is the most debilitating is the chronic pain that is present in my left shoulder blade. I have had 3 SLAP surgeries in the span of 14 months on the same shoulder. This was because we believed it was the root cause of my chronic left neck, scapula, chest, arm and hand pain. However, none of the surgeries resolved the issue.

I have seen primary care doctors, physical therapy, chiropractors, acupuncturists,  rheumatologists, and orthopedic surgeons to name a few methods. I can't even remember how many times I've had bloodwork, xrays or MRIs done. I also have my medical marijuana card (Michigan) which is about the only thing that provides any relief to the pain (which I can no longer afford because I've exhausted all my savings).

I had to drop out of college in my Junior year (2014) because I couldn't even make it through a 50 minute class. I now live at home with my parents who have to support me because I can't work. Simple things like tying my shoes, folding my laundry, and putting a dish in the dishwasher can be so taxing on me that I completely shutdown and have to lay down.

Because of all of this I have become severely depressed and have a ton of anxiety. I'm always worried about money, having suicidal ideation, and feeling like a burden on my parents, who are unable to retire due to myself (even though they won't admit it). I see all my friends in relationships, buying houses, graduating, and being successful in their career field. While I just sit at home and piggy back off my parents because I can't even manage to work as a fucking cashier at 24 years old.

What I'm trying to say is I just feel stuck. At the beginning of this journey I always believed someone would help me and the pain would go away and I could get my life back. However, I'm realizing now that I probably won't ever be pain free again in my life. My parents even sat me down the other day and told me I need to apply for disability which I couldn't ever imagined it would come to this.

Is this really it? I'm just screwed and told to ""cope"" the best I can because no one can figure out what is wrong with people like me? I don't want to die, but I also don't want to live like this for the rest of my life.

Sorry for the long post.

TL;DR: 24 y/o male suffering from Ankylosing Spondylitis, Fibromyalgia, and chronic pain (primarily in left scapular). Nothing I've tried over 4.5 years has helped my chronic shoulder and neck pain. All out of money, unable to work/go to school, and I'm miserable.",

451,I still want the invitation.,"Popped onto FB today and there was my new MIL (2 years) and my two SIL's (daughter and fostered in) out shopping for dresses. 

For what occasion? I don't know. 

But they went out today all together and I wasn't even invited. 

This used to happen all the time with my Mom and sisters (NC for over a decade). They would do things without me and not even bother inviting me because of course I had to say no anyway. It was always too long, too physical. Too much. 

But I always wanted the invite anyway. Just because. Even if we all knew I couldn't do it. Because it means that even if they knew I couldn't be there... they at least wanted me there. 

I know some people feel like its dragging our noses through the shit we can't do anymore. But nobody is even asking me about how I feel about this shit. 

I like stupid pretty dresses. I could have left when I got sore.

452,Charlotte's Web CBD Oils,"  Over the past month I have been experimenting with CBD tinctures and a topical cream to help with my back pain caused by lesions and nerve pain from Transverse Myelitis and NMOSD. I was seeing a minimal improvement with the American Shaman brand, but ordered Charlotte's Web after doing research. 

  I used a topical cream on my back mid-upper back to relieve pain and noticed manageable improvement. A little bit goes a long ways and I do find it worth the price. There is no lingering smell, no vaseline like residue that clings to your clothing, and I can feel a difference within usually 15 min. 

  The tinctures I had started to use seemed to be more helpful in my anxiety, stress, and ""needy"" feeling for my next opioid and narco doses. I would actually forget to take them on occasion. The Charlotte's Web tincture has proven to be the more effective one out of the two. 

  Today I woke up in unbearable pain due to my period starting. This usually causes my other symptoms to really flare up and made me utterly useless for most of the day. I was even at a point where I put off going to the bathroom that was ten steps away from me because I couldn't imagine moving. It had been well over an hour and a half since my last dose of pain and nerve medication so I decided to see if Charlotte's Web would finally bring relief. Within about 20 min it did. My pain was not 100% gone, this is not a ""fix all"", but I was in a manageable state to get up, do simple tasks that most take for granted, and not rely solely on my medications.

 I am not a spokesperson, I do not get monetary gain from this, and I purely just want to share what has been working for me in hopes that it could benefit someone else.

I tried to explain that all the helping he does with household stuff and emotional support is more than enough. I understand his frustration though. It has to be hard to watch your SO in pain and know you can’t take it away.  He also says he doesn’t think I lean on him enough and that I push myself too hard to do everything I used to. I think others can relate to the fact that it is hard to let people help when you are independent. It makes me feel incapable and reminds me that I’m sick.

Really, I'm sick of the people over at the hospitals. pharmacies, clinics, pain management, etc. referring to us as ""drug seekers"", especially how we are so underprescribed by our pain management doctors (especially how they're shoving the ridiculous and arbitrary CDC ""guideline"" (more like requirement) of the 90 MME limit, or six 10/325 Percocets onto Pain Management doctors) that we have to seek relief at the ER, which is where the discrimination does happen.

Also, regardless of what others have to say, including the doctors or the so--called professionals, let alone the anti-opioid morons that ignorantly brand anyone dependent or even simply suffering in chronic pain while on opioids as ""addicts/abusers in denial"", especially as some of these anti-opioid morons are actually abusers/addicts themselves if they've already opened themselves up, otherwise they're the privileged hypocrites that do lines of coke at a high end club in Hollywood while they pop the very same pills that they accuse us of abusing while they're doing it recreationally wihtout any medical issue whatsoever (pot calling the kettle black, ain't it?); this is clear discrimination against us chronic pain people that need opioids for our overall well being, especially how they look over our PDMP (prescription drug monitoring program) reports and without meeting us judge us as ""addicts/abusers"" due to the quantitiy higher than the rest of the public. THis shows how both undereducated and even ignorant of how doctors/pharmacists can be when it comes to understanding patients with chronic pain as the level they deem ""high"" (the amount of opioids taken) is what is average or even little compared to what the chronic pain patient truly needs, especially after years of tolerance, as they are confusing and comparing us to opioid-naive individuals, which is also why the CDC guidelines for PCPs to treat their chronica pain patients have such low limits as if they're treating first time patients with opioids.

476,An alternate to the 10 point pain scale,"New to the group, so sorry if this is the wrong place.

I have a lot of separate things that keep me in a lot of pain, all different kinds. Migraines are outright debilitating, tension and cluster headaches make me miserable, anxiety-caused mystery pains are sharp and intermittent then holy crap stop this now! IBS is infrequent but when it hits that's it for six hours. Every time I seek help I'm asked to rate my pain. Against what? Is a continual pain a higher number because it's constant, or is a pain that shows up once a week but slams me more important?

My point being, I hate the 10 point pain scale in all its forms. Not just the ""hurts a little bit...hurts a little more..."" but the ""moderate pain...worst possible pain"". Before I had a baby, I would have said 9 or even 10 for some of what I'd experienced to that point, but now that's at top an 8. Perspective changes, so the scale is useless.

So I had an idea. What if you rate pain on it's behavioral affects? Then it's less prone to ""this is worse than I've felt before, so it must be the maximum."" I was thinking two sets of questions and then add the total to get your 10 points.

Question one: What do you do when the pain comes on? 0) nothing 1) Grimace 2) Hold on to the affected spot 3) Stop doing certain things you want to/have to do 4) Rest in between tasks 5) Stop moving entirely until it goes away.

Question two: What would you do to get rid of the pain? 0) Nothing 1) Take over the counter medications or other home care 2) See a doctor 3) Go to weekly appointments for a few months 4) Have surgery 5) Anything someone you trust tells you to do.

Combining the two shows how some pains, while less severe, may still make you extremely motivated to get rid of it while some severe pains you've accepted and wouldn't risk large costs to remove from your life. I'll admit there's still individual differences here. People with restrictive work schedules literally can't afford weekly appointments but may see surgery and a short recovery time as feasible. Others who have had chronic pain for a long time can mask it well so behavioral changes don't happen as often.

What do you think?",
477,Doing A Bit Better,"Been living in level 5-10 chronic pain for over a decade now. Cerebral palsy (and the damage it’s done to my joints and muscles and bones), cll leukemia (and the damage it’s done to my internal organs and the chemo did to my body)and fatigue have made my life extremely difficult. My husband of 13 years died 5 months ago after a sudden stage 4 esophageal cancer diagnosis. So I’m alone, hurting more often than not and living with soul crushing grief/loneliness unable to work and terrified about where I’m going to end up.   



I’ve been EXTREMELY lucky to have a stepbrother and my bff (of 20 years) as well as other friends as a support group around me during all this. They’ve truly stepped up and make my life worth living at this point. Because of their love,care,and willingness to take care of me I’ve been doing ok and working on letting people in to my life/not being so isolated angry and judgmental. I realize that to get by in this life you have to ask for help and LET people help you.  



Ok now to my original point. I’ve been doing better physically. I’ve been pushing myself more and making myself attempt stuff I’d previously written off as undoable. The other day I went to a dr appointment and didn’t use my scooter. I decided that if I went slow and didn’t do any standing in line it might be ok and was definitely worth trying to do. And in the end, I was 100% able to do it. It raised my pain level but it was manageable.   




I’ve been making myself take care of my teeth better. It’s hard for me cuz depression but also first thing in the morning and last thing at night are times I’m at my lowest point energywize and physically. I don’t want to/ sometimes can’t stand for 5 minutes and do that. Also I’ve avoided the dentist except in emergency because of extreme anxiety due to prior major dental trauma. But I’ve made myself go to the dentist and start getting my dental stuff under control and I’m making myself brush/floss twice a day.  



Physically I’m getting stronger. My pain is still there and at times it’s super bad. Some days I’m totally couch bound. I’m extremely lonely and sad. I have so much fear and anxiety about so many things since my husband died. But I’m gonna make it, things are gonna get better and hopefully I’ll be able to get some of my physical capabilities back.

479,Nortriptyline for trigeminal neuralgia?,"I (20 years old, male, diagnosed with TN at 18, showing symptoms since 15-16) have been taking gabapentin for the past year or so, starting with 100mg once a day and working my way up to 300mg three times a day, though I regularly took 300mg twice a day (three times had some worse side effects and wasn't all that much better than twice a day), and while it did provide some relief, my primary care and I decided it would be worth it to try something else to see if that works better. I'd rather try other things than settle on something that kind of works and she understands that. (Her mom also has TN, which has proven really great because she knows her stuff.)

Yesterday I was prescribed nortriptyline (I believe the brand name is Pamelor) with instructions to take 10mg once a day for a week and then to move up to 20mg once a day for a week and then finally to 30mg once a day for a week. According to her most people find it works in as little as under 50mg per day, which I find appealing especially compared to gabapentin.

Has anyone taken nortriptyline for TN? And, if so, how did it work for you?

(Also related to this, I was instructed to stop taking gabapentin cold turkey. My roommate took it for several years for neuropathy related to rheumatoid arthritis at the same dosage I did and, when she stopped taking it, she had to be lowered off it in smaller increments like she did when starting to take it and she still experienced some pretty nasty withdrawal symptoms. I only took it for about a year, but I don't like the idea of just stopping if I had to build up to taking it. My primary care claims this is totally safe. But what have people's experiences been with stopping taking gabapentin?) ",
480,I was a tangled mess of pain .. On some fronts after years of different things i have made some progress. hope these things can help,"I am not a doctor .. and i am not telling you this will help you .. i am jsut saying give it a try ....  my doctors were of little help  I think because i had so many issues they did not even take a crack at it other than pain killer meds .. but i have refused drugs because they just put me to sleep and i would rather suffer in pain than be a sleeping zombie ... and when i did take them they would often make my tummy problems worse ... and i did not want to be addicted as i have a long way yet to go in life


I have been a tangle of pain... 

My hips and back and digestion all have been wacked for years .... ( and muscular leg problems )

Full body Massage ... Had never really been full body and maybe made things worse as it was not full body .... 

Now when i get a massage they Massage the front side of me and deep in my hip .. FUCK it hurts ... but my SI pain has finally let up !!! ( not totally escaped but it has let up )

On another front I noticed the foods i was sort of avoiding all had gulten as a factor .. so this summer i have taken gluten out of my diet ... while i have not been tested for a gluten problem i have had many invasive looks at my digestion and DRs never thought to try telling me to avoid gluten or be tested for the problem ...  

but since i have cut out gluten ... my super crappy feeling that has beeen sitting on me for years and years has fianly let up !!! 

those are the two different things that have both have helped me so far ... I know it seems almost to simple .. but i am not a doctor and was suffering so much pain that it was hard to even say what my symptoms as i had way way to much going on at the same time .. ( my pelvic floor has muscular  dysfunction also )   


good luck yall .. i might not be out of the woods but it is nice to come across a clearing in the forest now and again. ",

483,Dealing with non-chronic pain,"Hello all.

So, I broke my elbow (hairline fracture on the radial head) on Monday morning and I have come to some startling revelations because of it.

First off, let me just say how bizarre and wonderful it is to have an injury heal linearly. It does not get worse randomly. It went from lots of pain to less pain each day. It's almost satisfying? Although, I wouldn't break my arm again

Anyway, revelations:

1) I have a higher pain tolerance than I thought. I always thought that my pain tolerance was low, but I was going to work the whole day after breaking my arm, before I was told to go to the doctor. Glad I didn't, as that would have made it worse, but goodness.

2) I am not good at self-care. I guess this comes from being ""injured"" often, but I don't really stop doing things when in pain? This is bad for broken bones, even hairline fractures. I went to work again sooner than I should have, and made it slightly worse (don't worry, I just exhausted myself). I did dishes (using both hands), ignoring the gentle pain pulses through my elbow. I had to do dishes, so I did them. Even now, typing with both hands isn't really comfortable. I am so used to ignoring my bodies pain signals, to the point of maybe more damage? Like I want/need to do something, so I do it. I slept on my broken arm on night 3.

I also keep forgetting to take pain medication. It doesn't really help with my chronic pain issues, but it does for the bone. I keep thinking about how it hurts, which bothers me, and I will suddenly realize that there is actually a solution. I once forgot to take advil for 12 hours, and I just dealt with it.

I am not sure what to do with these revelations, and I don't really think it will change anything, but I thought I would share. Maybe someone else would get it?

I should also mention I sprained my ankle when I broke my elbow, and I never really stopped walking on it. Like two days later, I did walked at least 2 miles for fun. It hurt, but eh?

Edit: I went to a doctor the day I broke it, and I have a follow up next week.",

492,News from Austin for CPP.,"I have some very encouraging news to share from the recent trip to Austin (if someone hasn't already beaten me to it)! There were a couple of us who spoke on behalf of the pain community to the Texas House Select Committee on Opioids and Substance Abuse. This committee was charged in making recommendations for legislation regarding dealing with the ""opioids crisis"", which of course includes opioids prescriptions. The final word from the committee chair was they they were not going to recommend any legislation that limits opioid prescription use for those who have well documented needs, nor were they going to suggest any state mandated mme limit. So Yay for Texas!! At this point, things are looking a little more hopeful for the pain community as a whole in our state! Thank you all for your prayers and well wishes as we spoke regarding this life &amp; death issue. The committee chair mentioned that rarely a day goes by when he doesn't receive a plea from someone in our community asking not to have our medications taken away - so that tells me that all the letters, emails and phone calls have been effective too! You are now free to breathe a victorious sigh of relief... 😊",

494,"Do you guys think it would be crazy to start lobbying for pain relief as a right? Too many doctors fall back on, “there’s no right to pain relief” in my opinion. I feel it completely ignores the long term ptsd like issues that can come from chronic pain.","Not to mention, the absolute agony of dealing with our pain, while the CDC and others have decided for us, that we’ll just “have to make do and live with it.” I feel like no one should be on a committee making these choices for others unless they have gone through it. The reason I believe this is so critical in this area is because pain is subjective. Without the proper frame of reference it’s virtually impossible for them to make a reasonable determination.  This is different than with other diseases, where blood counts can be measured, biopsies taken. But with pain they can’t externally take a measure other than perhaps your heart rate as you suffer. 

I guess I’m more than a little salty because I’m currently being railroaded down by more than 30%. Thank God I just got my spinal stimulator, but my doctors telling me it’s a hospital wide thing, where the doctors aren’t being given a choice about scaling back. 

Didn’t mean to rant really. I just want to see some enforced empathy as it would appear to be sorely and unreasonably lacking in healthcare providers.

I've been getting ketamene treatments in addition to the daily stack of pills I take for my litany of issues. They have been helping so much.

But CRPS is still a boogie man. It attacks when I'm doing fine and takes me down. I go from heathly to utterly incapacited. 

My leg starts hurting at work. Next day a little more, back is hurting more too. Then my leg really hurts but I have to run errands.

By night both legs down to the ankle are on fire. Left arm and shoulder are burning and as always, as issues stem from spine, my back is lit too. I also started a bit ago getting shocks in my fingers and toes so why not add that in.

Then birth control has been giving me Severe anxiety so now I'm panicking about work. Then the stress sleep comes do I wake up from nightmares, stress, and pain. Then the anxiety turns to panic. I can't sleep because of so many reasons and now the intense anxiety has me hyperfocussed on the idea that my house is haunted and I am being watched.

With less sleep I'm doing worse physically. I'm doing worse mentally. But it's 5am and I've been up since 1:20.

I'm so scared I'm going to lose my job. I can't. I can't keep losing everything from this disease and re building. I can't. I want this job to be a 20 year long commitment. I missed yesterday I can't miss two days.

I saw my GP (I'm in Canada) and she thinks it's either EDS or Marfan Syndrome (due to the dent in my chest, my height, my hypermobility, etc) so she's put in a referral for me to see a geneticist and an internist. I've also been getting blood work done and I will be getting x-rays and an echo-cardiogram done. She also pointed out that I also have mild scoliosis which she says is another warning sign. She said she can't confirm my diagnosis until they've ruled other stuff out but it's probably Marfan (especially since I a lot of people on my mom's side have similar symptoms as me including the chest divot).

I feel so much better knowing that it wasn't in my head. I hope I can see the geneticist soon.

Sorry if this isn't relevant. This is my first time really addressing my pain and it makes me happy to see it taken so seriously. I've been having an awful case of restless legs at night that have been driving me insane so this was some good news for me.

I just want to know what your experience with MDMA and other recreational drugs while suffering with chronic pain.

I have used quite a lot of recreational drugs while in pain and I have found that some of then exacerbates my pain, while others distract me and make me forget about my pain for a while. Acid for example always makes my entire spine hurt, I normally just have low back and sacrem/butt pain, with occasional upper back pain, but on acid my whole back hurts. 

So what's your experience with drugs and pain? Especially MDMA and psychedelics?

 It has ups and down now but has been getting worse lately. It takes me an hour or two to fall asleep. My headache gets real bad if I either law down or sit for too long. I also usually feel nauseous near the end of the day and have to lay down. 

Since my medical runs out next year I wanted to try and fully explain all my issues and get sone kind of diagnosis and maybe see some kind of specialist. 

I saw a new doctor today and she seemed very dismissive. I asked her for any sort of treatment I could do to help fix myself, and that I didn't really want to be on pain medication and let whatever's wrong get worse. She said something about how for my neck there is scar tissue that will always be there and nothing can be done? I'm not sure what that means?  My previous doctor never said anything about scare tissue? I don't have a visible scar so maybe she meant in my muscles somehow? Not sure. I did lose some curvature in my neck but I haven't had an xray done in a couple years. 

For my eyes my vision is perfect. I tried to explain my actual eyes are fine and its behind them that always hurts, but she said that when I had an mri years ago anything wrong would have shown up there. But it still hurts behind them constantly so not sure what to do about that? It has to be something right?

510,"I faceplanted so hard during a run through the woods, the adrenaline/endorphins was stronger than any meds I've ever been on. This is the first time I've fallen in over 5 years and I want to say it felt amazing.","I recently found a medication regiment which keeps my muscles of my pelvic floor under under control, which I discovered a few months back was the real cause of all this misery. As such I've been pushing back against my inactivity with ferocity. This has been going on for over 8 years, and I've tried absolutely everything. It turned out all i needed was 2mg of valium to keep these muscles from clamping my testicles/penis/spinal area and radiation pain all up and down my body. (in case anyone cares I suffered a pelvic injury around 2011 at a young age and was recently diagnosed by a ""super specialist"" with Chronic Pelvic Floor Dysfunction/Chronic Pelvic Pain Disorder. I waited almost 3 months for the appointment and was out in under an hour of talking to the doctor, who took 2 phone calls during the appointment since he was the only doctor in the state who doesn't just say ""you've got prostatitis"" and sends you home with antibiotics)     
      
2 fucking milligrams. I've been up over 90mg a day of morphine, stoned out of my mind, and here the answer was the whole time.      
       
So here I was 6 months into the muscle relaxant regiment, walking the trails in the woods as I had been doing for the last few weeks after YEARS of essentially being completely bedridden aside from a few hours a day of extremely limited mobility.     
       
I started to think about how much fun it used to be to race through these trails on a bike, quad, etc. I was at the top of a big hill which swerves around like a race track, and in a single moment without a single thought I was running. RUNNING. Guys, I haven't moved in years.     
      
So I'm pushing the limits, racing up and down these trails with a fat shit eating grin on my face blasting Red Hot Chili Peppers and feeling just fucking amazing. I'm coming up a big hill which has an even bigger drop after. I know these trails so well I can navigate in the pitch black and not miss a single turn or get even a little lost. So I'm coming up this hill and when I get to the top I JUMP high into the air and feel the ground drop out under me. A big branch catches my feet and I feel myself falling forward. Hard. But I'm in control, the entire time I'm completely in control.     
    
I hit the soft undergrowth laden ground face first and start rolling head over heels down this big hill. I roll exactly three times and IMMEDIATELY jump up to my feet. I don't feel a fucking thing. I KEEP RUNNING. it was a total of 15 minutes spent running full tilt, but I swear it's the best 15 minutes I've had in the last 8 years.     
     
I'm all bloodied and covered in dirt, bugs in my hair, clothes just drenched in sweat.         
      
The adrenaline kept me going the entire walk home, and I'm ready to get into bed and chug a big kratom lemonade and puff down a fat joint, waiting for the pain to finally hit.      
      
After sitting in my desk chair with all my meds weighed our for a half hour I realize THE PAIN ISN'T COMING.

I told him he could either help me or he could wash the bed clothes when I pissed myself. It's a good thing I don't eat or drink since I have no way of getting to the toilet on my own. I can't even reach my laptop, it's stupidly hot because he didn't open the window for me and I'm so close to snapping. At least we had carers last time.

I'd genuinely rather die. As if the pain wasn't hard enough to deal with. We'd only need carers once a day for half an hour. But we can't even afford that and they won't help fund it. It's a joke. Good to know that disabled people are an important part of society. Social worked kept telling me yesterday how they could help me get out of the house and do volunteering. After I told her I physically couldn't sit up because it caused so much pain, let alone get in a car. Never mind the fact that the local disabled transport people use a minibus which means no suspension. They'd have to take me straight to the ER since it would make my pain go from 8/10 to 10/10. I'm really not coping and all I can think about is dying. Because god knows it's hurts bad enough. 

Meanwhile I'm trying to get a home visit from the doctor since I can't breathe even with steroids (thanks gastroparesis!) but I've been fighting for a home visit since last week and no one is even trying to help me.

Right now am taking Tilidin for pain and Amitriptyline 10 mg every night. If I take a pain med after 5 or 6 pm I cannot fall asleep till 4 am or so. If I don't take amitriptyline I won't fall asleep at all. This happens not just with Tilidin, also with Tramadol and Tapentadol, even if they are slow release. For a while I was using Buprenorphine 10mcg/hour patch, it gave me relief and didn't cause as much sleep problems but mornings were tough when pain was the highest. 

My doctor asked me to take 20 mg of amitriptyline but that works only for a night or 2 and then it's back to being awake till 4 or 5 am. Thru trial and error I found out that the 10 mg amitriptyline that I take has to be taken around 8.30 pm everyday. Beyond 9 pm and I don't fall asleep. As advised by my doc I tried taking the second tablet a little later and then both together and so on trying different timings but sleep problems continued so I now take only 10 mg. If I don't take a pain med in the evening, I still won't sleep as the pain will keep me awake.

Is insomnia a common problem when taking pain meds? If so, have you been prescribed something for sleep? I have now got a short term job that I can do remotely but I still need to wake up in the morning to be available for discussions. I'll be seeing my doctor tomorrow to discuss this sleep problem yet again. I just wanted to see if any of you are having similar problems and what are you taking to fall asleep.",

522,New PM doctor wants to switch me from 15mg Oxycodone IR to Morphine IR ? Anyone have any input?,"I have been on 15mg IR oxycodone 4pills a day, every 6hrs for a few years now, have been on pain medication for about 10 total. I am in Arizona, for reference.

Left my PCP to try out Pain Management as my current  dose isnt working due to increased pain. 

First PM apt 2 weeks ago they refused to increase by 1 pill a day or pill strength until I had a new MRI done.

Did the MRI and had my 2nd apt today with an NP at the PM office near me, different doc than last visit. 

I brought my report and disk from the MRI just in case. It showed my back issues plus some new issues. 

The doc then proceeded to tell me I should get the nerve burning and she thinks that may help, and itll take 2 visits getting lidocaine injections before insurance will cover it  ext ext so essentially saying 2 months from now. 

I tell her I cannot go on in this much pain for months longer. I asked to adjust my dose for the meantime either in mg per pill or more pills in a day. She then says that wont help me and i need a ""vacation"" from oxycodone and she wants to switch me to Morphine pills equivalent to the oxycodone I am on now. She thinks itll make my body ""reset"" and my oxycodone will work the following month. 

I have never taken morphine pills. Anyone ever heard of this being done? Experience with this, or morphine pills vs oxycodone? 

Thank you 

Update: I have decided to set a follow up discussion apt with the PM clinic. This time I asked to see one of the MD's on staff instead of an NP which is who I saw for the last apt. My apt is next week, I am going to go over everything that is going on, and what the NP wanted to do with the med vacay and see what his take is. Will update this after.",
523,Severe Costochondritis Episode Tips?,"So I was diagnosed with costochondritis a few months ago. Most of the time I'm fine but when it hits, it hits HARD and sudden and I'm writhing in agony on the floor for a good half hour.

524,How not to dwell on potential serious diagnosis?,"I know this isn’t a chronic pain post per say but I am a person with chronic pain and a doctor slipped up and mentioned the possibility of me having a serious neurological conditions and I’m hysterical. How do you cope with the possibility of something serious or life-ending ?

I’ll give some context: so I have Crohn’s disease and some combo of rheumatoid and psoriasis arthritis and I’ve been given IV steroids which have helped those but recently I went to the eye doctor because I had some vision changes I assumed were from the steroids and it turns out it might be at worse a tumor. Kept having double vision ONLY with my glasses on and when looking far away (I’m nearsighted so makes sense) and I expected my prescription or glasses were wrong or misaligned and I explained all this and my doctor did some further testing and found no fault in my eyes which I expected because duh I don’t have double vision without the glasses on, but instead she just blurted “well I can’t find anything wrong with your eyes but I’m gonna make you an appointment for tomorrow with the head doctor to see what’s next; since there isn’t a physical anomaly it is likely neurological and probably serious” and no matter how many times I said it’s not without the glasses she wouldn’t listen and affirmed it was likely serious.  To me it seems totally obvious it’s the glasses but the sheer mention of any further problems has given me existential anxiety: I was 10 lbs away from death a few years ago from crohns, and I accidentally took an extra pill and ended up in the hospital overnight for and accidental overdose and I can’t take the possibility of anything further I’m so sick of doctors I’m sick of fighting I already have enough problems and I can’t come to terms that if it’s true I’m just gonna throw in the towel. Hard pill to swallow but I don’t know how I’d go on with more grade A medical bullshit. 

Sorry for the rant, TL;DR: how do you all cope with the possibility of something out of your control? How do I not focus on a relatively minor chance of something serious or having to go through more medical testing or procedures or surgeries? Any help would be appreciated, any advice or comments at all. I’m 17 and I don’t know how to stomach it all",
525,An anesthesologists take on the 'new anesthesia.',"It sounds scary, but it’s not. I practice anesthesia. Yes, in the old days we gave tons of opioids intraop, often resulting in postop vomiting, slow to wake patients, and delay in return of bowel sounds. For several years now we’ve been replacing traditional opioids with other types of pain killer during anesthesia. Just keep in mind, there is still effective pain control, it’s just different drug classes being used. I often use Precedex infusions (alpha agonist), ketamine boluses (NMDA antagonist), and lidocaine infusions...all give excellent pain control as effective as opioids but without the side effects of opioids. I also use Ofirmev and Calador in conjunction with these other drugs. Lastly, when appropriate. I use peripheral nerve blocks, spinals, and continuous epidurals for postop pain control. 
Yes, there are times I still give opioids. But it’s not always necessary in order to achieve fantastic pain relief. Realistically, some pain is always to be expected after surgery. But it should be minimal. My last 2 anesthetics I’ve had done on myself have been opioid free, and I had the same amount of pain control after as with surgeries I received opioids during. The only difference was I wasn’t nauseated when I woke up!!  For my knee surgery I had a epidural infusion for postop pain. It was fantastic!!!",
526,No Enjoyment in Life,"I'm chronically ill with at least 3 conditions that leave my doctors going ""huh?"" or ""how do you spell that?"" This is, of course, extemely discouraging, so much so that I now avoid doctors rather than seek any help because nothing good ever happens. Just disappointment and hopelessness.

I'm 23 years old, I should be living it up and enjoying the crap out of life right now. I should be making mindless mistakes and learning how to navigate every facet of life. I should be learning who I am as a person and doing things I love. But I don't. I can't even say I like anything...

Whenever anyone asks me what I do for fun, I can't answer them. I don't do anything special that I enjoy, nothing helps me relax or pulls me out of the pain. I'm not ""into"" anything, I don't have a hobby or a favorite TV show or book. I find myself sitting silently in my living room for hours at a time, maybe just scrolling on my phone, no tv, no music. I sleep a lot because I'm exhausted, but I can't even say I like sleeping. It sucks when some days you sleep 18 hours a day, wake up cranky, not feeling rested at all, and feeling like crap about it because you've done absolutely nothing with your day.

I wish I had passion. I wish I had something that made me happy and made life more enjoyable. I can say I love the f-ck out of my husband and our furry family members, but for some reason I can't call that my escape. I still get crabby with them around, and I still hate life sometimes. They don't help me escape from the internal battles I face daily. In fact, sometimes they're the only reason I stick around...

How do you find your passion, your happiness, your job in life? Is this just something I'm lacking altogether, or is there a process I can explore to help me find an enjoyable hobby? I feel like a weirdo because I don't know how to do this...",

I LOVE going to craft stores, antiquing, and just generally looking at interesting shops. I miss going to sidewalk sales and markets, and it SUCKS. 

BUT, with etsy I can just scroll for hours looking at lovely handmade crafts or antique shit and it’s so great. I looked for ideas for my engagement ring and I was shocked at how much pretty, legit jewelry was on there! I’m so happy I can continue my hobby of looking at things I can’t afford and things no one should ever buy online lol. 

Honestly though there are also great things. I bought honey on there last week like?? I highly recommend it. Since so many brick and mortar shops have their stock on etsy, it’s feeling less shit that I can’t go outside that much!!

She kind of freaked me out, haha.

Has anyone had the procedure done?  Is it a long, painful recovery?  Did you go back to work relatively quickly?  If you had the choice would you go back and do it again?  I've read some stuff on Google searches but it would be nice to hear first hand accounts.  Thanks for your time!",
530,"This article from 2018 says that the ""opioid crisis"" is absolutely not due to pain patients' prescription use","Thought this might be of interest to others, and maybe it's worth sharing with your doctors or sending to any advocacy groups or politicians with whom you speak -- it's from April 2018, from a peer-reviewed journal:   


[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6018937/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6018937/)  


The author says:   


&gt;Sharp increases in opioid prescriptions, and associated increases in overdose deaths in the 2000s, evoked widespread calls to change perceptions of opioid analgesics. Medical literature discussions of opioid analgesics began emphasizing patient and public health hazards. Repetitive exposure to this information may influence physician assumptions. While highly consequential to patients with pain whose function and quality of life may benefit from opioid analgesics, current assumptions about prescription opioid analgesics, including their role in the ongoing opioid overdose epidemic, have not been scrutinized.

&gt;Opioid analgesic prescribing and associated overdose deaths both peaked around 2011 and are in long-term decline; t**he sharp overdose increase recorded in 2014 was driven by illicit fentanyl and heroin.** Nonmethadone prescription opioid analgesic deaths, in the absence of co-ingested benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other central nervous system/respiratory depressants, are infrequent. Within five years of initial prescription opioid misuse, 3.6% initiate heroin use. The United States consumes 80% of the world opioid supply, but opioid access is nonexistent for 80% and severely restricted for 4.1% of the global population.

He concludes (this is all important): 

&gt;Many current assumptions about opioid analgesics are ill-founded. **Illicit fentanyl and heroin, not opioid prescribing, now fuel the current opioid overdose epidemic.** National discussion has often neglected the potentially devastating effects of uncontrolled chronic pain. **Opioid analgesic prescribing and related overdoses are in decline, at great cost to patients with pain who have benefited or may benefit from, but cannot access, opioid analgesic therapy.**

The linked article has much more detail, and an excellent history of pain medication prescribing. I recommend reading it if you have the inclination and time.

534,Advice? How do I keep going? Mind over matter?,"Was in a car accident (accidents, I guess. We got hit several times in the space of minutes) a few weeks ago and things are extremely painful (neck, back, shoulders). The neck in particular is awful. I got a tramadol prescription and finally broke down enough to take it. A few questions:

\- How do you stay productive and self disciplined to power through this much pain? And when in less pain, it is due to tramadol. How do you guys stay productive and do work when in this medicated fog or non-medicated hellhole? I have a deadline in late September and I have to study hard in preparation for that. 

\- I am in physical therapy. I have been trying acupuncture/massage, etc. All three are on hold for a few days until an MRI rules some additional things out. But they barely help and in PT's case, it feels worse.

\-Really need advice on how to power through this enough that I can study. It was so bad that I cried today at my computer. After crying all night because I couldn't sleep.

Every day is turning into me finally getting out of bed and staring at my computer screen trying to get myself to concentrate. I get nothing done each day. I sit there and I cannot focus at all (I have a concussion too but my doctor said I could try working for a bit each day - too much rest is detrimental - and  right now I am accomplishing ZERO). Then I switch off the computer, take a break, and return ... only to stare vacantly at the screen while the muscles/nerves/who knows what shriek in protest.

\- I know it has only been a few weeks.... but I really ..... I am at a crucial point trying to start and be ready for this program. It is killing me mentally, to be so behind, on top of all this additional stress. 

How do I build the self discipline to power through this? What do I do? Right now, my medical team are throwing medicines, physical therapy, and the promise of time healing all things at me. It doesn't change the fact that time stops for no one and that I have shit to do. Halp.

TLDR - accident. struggling with meds and without meds. trying to be productive bc right now, I am basically seaweed and it is driving me insane while an impending deadline looms. Help. How do I power through this. Right now it is beating me. Hard.

535,FMLA/leave of absence rant,"Not sure where to start because I'm in an extremely panicked state of mind. I have been diagnosed with facet joint arthritis, and recently the pain even with painkillers has been so bad I'd have to leave work early nearly every day. I have depleted all my time banks and none of my treatments have been working (a ton of injections, basically) so I wanted time to try to get my back pain managed.

I filed for a leave of absence and made an appointment with a new primary care to get the paperwork signed off, last Monday. She \*seemed\* nice and understanding, but then gave me a call a couple days later saying she cannot sign off on medical leave. When I asked why, she said my condition did not require a leave of absence, even after having viewed my MRI and all my medical records from my spine doc.

After that, I set an appointment up with my spine doc, thinking that since I am an established patient it wouldn't be any trouble to get my leave paperwork signed. I was just refraining from driving there in the first place because it is an hour away (more pain from driving) . She refused to sign off on a full leave of absence, and said ""I shouldn't be disabled from working"" (actual quote).

My leave of absence case manager says I  have 4-5 more days to get the FMLA paperwork signed off but I don't know what to do next. I don't feel like my next couple days are covered in terms of time banks so I am terrified of HAVING to go to work and forcing myself through that routine and setting myself up for failure. My boss has shown absolutely no empathy and I'm so wrought with anxiety and depression I really don't know what to do next. 

I could risk it and try taking the next couple days off to see more doctors who blow me off or don't believe me, or I could force myself to go to work. Either way it seems like I'm screwed. If anyone has ANY information about FMLA and that paperwork that might help please let me know. I'm panicking so badly and I'll probably delete this post ... Someone here suggested that I go to urgent care for the paperwork but I called several local ones and none of them are (apparently) authorized to fill it out. ",

537,Are there really people in the world who aren't in constant pain? Is it strange that I find this really hard to believe--that some people are just... comfortable?,"This might be the wrong place to ask this, but it's the only place I can think to get answers. It has just occurred to me after 21 years of life that being in constant pain might not be normal, but I can't wrap my head around the idea that it's not. This may be totally dumb, but I'm being completely honest. I just always assumed that existence = hurting all the time. 

I've been in pain for a really long time--as long as I can remember actually! And it's never been anything too bad, just a dull consistent ache through my entire body, similar to the aches you get from the flu or a cold i think. I've been to the doctor once or twice for different things, and could probably put my lowest constant pain level at maybe a 4?  Occasionally I'll have back spasms for a few days or be unable to move or just be bone deep exhausted from the smallest things like walking across the room or something, but it really never occurred to me that this was strange? Like of course I'm achy all the time. That's the cost of breathing or whatever. I always just thought of it as more chronic discomfort than chronic pain.

I always just assumed I just complained to much or made something out of nothing. Like I said, I really can't remember not being in pain but it just now occurred to me that there  might be something actually wrong with me? And maybe if there is I might be able to manage it and be more comfortable someday possibly? 

But then, like I said, I function fine. I'm a slow walker and can't run or jump or stand for very long without my bones hurting, but I just always thought I was lazy or something. That I needed to exercise more and then I'd be fine. 

 I just--am I making something out of nothing? Does Chronic Pain only come after a specific injury? Has anyone else had trouble coming to terms with the idea that their pain might not be normal? Or feared they might be making a mountain out of a molehill? Am I just being a wimp?

548,"F, 30 - hip and leg pain for almost a year. Should I get another shot?","Hi everybody.  Like my title says, I’m a 30 yr old female with chronic hip, leg and lower back pain.  It only occurred to me to search for a chronic pain subreddit last night, and reading everyone’s stories makes me feel less alone in this new world I’m in. So hi, here’s a bit about me. 

My pain has been going on since Nov 2017. Initially started in 2015 as a twinge in my lower back, sometimes when I twisted by back to pop my hip. Nothing more than a tightness when I was laying down. But then it started to spread to my hamstrings. Couldn’t sleep without stretching my leg out. Back started spasming more, like when I was swimming or tensed my back up quickly like you do to prevent yourself from falling backwards. Then in Nov/Dec started waking up in the middle of the night because of my whole leg spasming. Then the ache in my hip began. It has yet to go away. Deep, sore ache that spreads from my hip all the way down to my outer shin. My back spasms when I move a certain way, and my leg muscles cramp in and out all day.

I’ve seen doctors, surgeons, chiropractors, physical therapists, massage therapists. Nothing has worked. I’m round the clock anti inflammatories (Aleve, aspirin, meloxicam, whatever is working that day), biofreeze, and lidocaine patches. Tried Gabapentin, couldn’t tell if that worked. Muscle relaxers, maybe work? Can’t tell a big change from those either. I’ve gotten an epidural cortisone shot (didn’t work), X-rays showed nothing. MRI showed a bulging L4-L5 disk but the spinal surgeon said he didn’t think that was causing my pain. Didn’t suggest what could be causing it instead.  Thanks, doc.

New pain doctor wants to give me cortisone in my SI joint and piriformis. I’m hesitating because my experience with the first one was bad. Made the pain worse. Anyone had this done? How did it go for you?

Anyone else have suggestions on what to try next?
Currently planning to try shiasu massage, gyrokinetics, and light exercise.

I've got severe joint pain pretty much everywhere, but it's a constant part of my life in my right knee, so after months of falling and tripping and not being able to walk, I bought a cane. I don't use it at work (because my job duties don't really work with working with canes) but getting to and from. I use it walking down the street, and going to the store, getting around my apartment.

The part I'm struggling with is my anxiety. I really don't know if this is the place to post this, I've never posted here before, but I'm having almost constant panic attacks when I use the cane, just because of how... stupid I feel. I'm 18, I'm not ""obviously"" impaired, and I am in good health otherwise. Elderly people give me dirty looks, kids laugh at me, people have asked me if it's a fashion statement. I'm worried people think I'm making fun of ""real"" disabled people. If people think I'm some idiot millennial that uses a cane for fun. Or that I'm faking it.

So I started getting blinding agony on my neck around three years ago after sleeping on a couch and then having my neck bent way too far forward by my partner. Long story. 

Two years of scans, checks and investigations by doctors helped and found nothing. Spondorosis was my diagnosis, which just basically means neck pain and minor erosion. 

I saw physios, osteopaths, rheumatologists, pain specialists and a million gps. I had mris and X-rays. 

After two years I go to a chiropractor. They do some X-rays and show me that while there is little damage, my curve has disappeared. In fact my neck was measurably bending the wrong way. 

It was very validating to know why I was in pain at least, and that it wasn’t in my head (as people were long past suggesting) and I commenced treatment which cost a fortune for someone to essentially crack my back. Felt nice but it wasn’t fixing anything. 

A quick google search a few weeks ago threw up an exercise to normalise c spine curvature. 

You need literally five minutes a day and a towel. 

https://saveourbones.com/weekend-challenge-cervical-curve-normalizer/

Combined with this: https://saveourbones.com/weekend-challenge-thoracic-spine-strengthener/ 

To strengthen the area. 

I touched my chin to my chest without pain yesterday for the first time in three years. 

You have to keep it up I’m finding, but this has changed my life, and my quality of life overnight. 

And these so called experts would prefer to take my money than to hand me something so simple. 

Obviously this is not one size fit all, but unless there’s a structural reason why you shouldn’t this exercise would benefit pretty much anybody. 

If you have diagnosed loss of curvature, or unexplained persistent neck pain, please try it. 

Hope this can be of use to some! ",

561,VENT: bad relapse after medication mishap,"I have previously posted on here about the immense success I have had with ketamine IV's. I went from being unable to leave the house 50% of the time because I was unable to walk from pain (base painlevel 6-7, peaks to 9) to living a normal life with no noticeable pain on a daily basis (base painlevel 1-2, peaks to 5-6). This has been AMAZING and all happened between october last year and around march/april I reached having no noticeable 24/7 pain (it's still there, but if I'm doing things living life I don't notice it because it's so little). Unfortunately I've had a major relapse recently and I can't deal with it:

about 5 weeks ago my GP accidentally gave me only half the dosage of my antidepressants. this was a genuine mistake, it shouldn't have happened, everyone involved is incredibly sorry and knows this is a HUGE fuck-up and if it had been for example blood-pressure medication someone could've been dead. about 1 week after this sudden cut in my meds, I was suicidal. (thanx to my amazing friends and family for catching me when I went down that slope and making sure I was safe and getting help) Luckily we figured out what had happened and I was put back on the correct dosage. What followed was weeks of agony because those meds take a while to kick in fully again. I suffered severe depression and anxiety. All of this made my pain go up a lot; I was back to being at a solid 5 24/7 and was super happy I had another ketamine IV coming up because I thought everything would be ""back to normal"" after this.

It's not.

I forgot that the IV's usually lower my base painlevel about 1-2 points, so now I'm stuck at a 3-4, and it's driving me insane. I know that this is not a ""high number"" and I know I've dealt with much much much worse, but that requires a different state of mind and after spending several months living a normal almost pain-free life, I am no longer in that mindset. The first time it took me more than a year to be able to cope with having pain 24/7, and I was so happy that this time was over. I can't deal with it now. I can't deal with the fact that it's ALWAYS THERE again and making it impossible for me to concentrate on working. This is psychologically ruining me, I feel absolutely horrible.

I'm in the final stages of doing my master thesis and I can't work like this; my thesis has been suspended several times for medical reasons and I just want to get it done, I need to be finished with it. I just don't know how to continue right now.  


How do I re-accept the pain being there 24/7 quickly? Last year I was walking around uni nearly fainting from pain several times per day and yet I was still there and passing exams; I need to get back to that state of mind ASAP so I can finish my thesis, but how?!","central sensitization, endometriosis, chronic back pain"

563,Drove 2 hours for a neurosurgery consult...,"On Thursday I drove up to MUSC Charleston to see a neurosurgeon. I have MRIs done of my back almost yearly. This year, I had my entire spine done because I’m also having hand and arm issues. It showed several herniated discs from my neck all the way down to my s1. The lower ones I knew about. The neck makes sense because of the numbness I’ve been experiencing. 
Anyways, I’ve had lower back issues for 8 years since I was in a car accident. It’s progressively gotten worse and I had a discectomy back in 2012 on my L3/4 which helped with the numbness but not the pain. Since then, the pain has gotten worse. The MRI showed that the herniation at my L5 has gotten worse. My pain management doctor recommended I have surgery and explained that it’s probably the reason why I’ve got awful pain and burning down both of my legs (it comes and goes but when it’s there, it’s absolutely horrible). 
The surgeon said he can see all of the problems, but to him it’s a 50/50. The herniation isn’t *that* bad and he said it’s not causing all of the pain,numbness and burning in my legs. He says that’s from the degenerative discs in my lower back. He said if that specific herniation gets worse, it will cause loss of bladder and bowel function which is irreversible. 
I’m so confused and upset and it’s taken me a few days to even try to process all of this info. He doesn’t want to operate but will if it gets worse. He said I will always have the pain because of the degenerative discs and said to call ASAP if I get tingling/numbness by my privates because I’ll need surgery on my L5. So what am I supposed to do? Just sit and wait for it to happen? I feel like I was told that at 35 years old, this is the best I’m ever going to feel because the pain will either stay the same or get worse from here. 
His PA also told him that I’m on a “considerable amount” of narcotic pain meds (50mg Nucynta ER 2x/day and hydrocodone 10 every 6 hours as needed)
I’m just at a loss as to what to do. ",

566,Off to hospital for ketamine infusions,"Hello!

My name is Claire and I live in Melbourne, Australia. I had surgery for lateral epicondylitis in November 2017. I also showed symptoms of posterior inter-ossues nerve compression so my surgeon fixed that during the surgery as well. Unfortunately I developed complex regional pain syndrome as a direct result of my surgery.

On Wednesday I’m going to hospital for a week (maybe more, maybe less) for ketamine infusions. I posted a while back about this but at that time I wasn’t 100% sure that this was definitely going to happen. But my CRPS has gotten a lot worse due to stress that the insurance company (my injury was work related) is putting me under.

I’ve been depressed about everything that’s going on. I was in a very dark place but I’m very lucky to have an amazing husband who looks after me and the bestest friends in the whole world. They recently put together a care package with all my favourite things (including chocolates, socks and a huge Jiggypuff plush just to name a few) to make me feel better.

I’m really nervous about going into hospital. I know I will be looked after but I’m so worried the infusions are not going to work and I’m going to be like this forever. I would really love to hear some positive stories before I go in to put my mind in a better place. I don’t know anybody with chronic pain so I thought posting in here might be the best bet.

569,Suboxone for pain?,"This is a throwaway account.

There's a tiny bit of background about my situation (and inane stupidity) in the only other post I have on this account, so if you want to read that, please do.

I was on fentanyl for pain (plus morphine for breakthrough pain) for about a decade, and only recently got off it. And when I say recently, I mean a couple weeks (this is where the other post's relevance/situation comes in; also the reason behind my username). Our state is cracking down on the ""opidemic"" - and they are going at it ridiculously. The legislators are even suing the frigging pharmacies for ""enabling"" this ""opidemic"". Nonetheless, I wasn't affected by this while I was still on them, thankfully. 

I still wanted to get off the opiates because I absolutely hated being dependent on opiates, and after what happened, it was the perfect time to do so. 

The pain clinic I go to also prescribes Suboxone for pain relief (they have to start tapering on the opiates as per state law); the pcp I go to does the same for his patients; the other clinic I go to where I get trigger point injections does the same. Apparently, it's a big thing now. I was told that it works incredibly well for pain, and I was so excited. 

It does nothing. *NOTHING*. I feel like everyone is lying to me, even though I know they're not. On a pain scale - when I was on the fentanyl - I could go down to a 3; with this, I never go down past 6, and am frequently at a 9. Literally, I'm in bed, crying, not able to move. I also didn't realize just how much the affected areas of my body hurt when I'm not being treated, and that even without the specific areas, I have serious pains in places I wasn't truly aware of *because* it was being treated.

My husband and I are driving to Nevada in the morning to stock up on cannabis, which is very illegal in my state. But I don't know how much more I can take of this, you know? 

The thing is, my doctor is all for it (cannabis); she said that when I can, get however much I can and use it when needed. It's just that the timing right now isn't the best, because we're trying to find something that will truly work to control pain, but what isn't marijuana (thanks, Utah), or opiates (again, thanks Utah). Suboxone is doing shit-all nothing, too, so...

This is basically a rant, but... I did want to ask you guys what do you do for pain? Is there something that you use to help? I can't do opiates anymore, I'm apparently one of the 2% on whom Suboxone doesn't work, and I can't rely on cannabis forever. I know, I still don't know what else is going to be suggested by my doctors, but, I still want to know.

Thanks for reading.

I am terrified of surgery. I had a double mastectomy a few years ago that was fine but prior to that, I had a nightmare. It got infected. It went septic. I was in an induced coma for my 18th birthday. I missed most of my senior year of high school and rapidly developed CRPS which took years to get diagnosed. I am missing muscles and nerve endings because damaged tissue needed to be removed from my body.

580,My pain doc keeps giving me anticonvulsants :(,"Very quick background - Im 33 and have suffered with chronic pain in my neck which radiates to my shoulders, jaw, teeth, sinuses since I was about 18/19 but it only got severe when I had braces fitted age 26-29. 
Because of my age I’ve had a hard time getting help and being believed but when I got a referral to a private pain specialist she ordered an MRI which showed arthritis in my neck and mild-moderate bone spurs at C-6 on the right hand side and moderate-severe bone spurs on the left side ‘probably compressing the nerve at C7 level’ 

Last year when I moved to Queensland I found a great doctor who believed me and put me on Endone (a box a week) then switched to Targin after 8 months or so. To be fair my tolerance had skyrocketed and the endone/Targin wasn’t doing much. I also suffer from anxiety and depression but have been getting intense CBT &amp;amp;; schema therapy plus am seeing a psychiatrist who has finally found the right anti depressant for me after many years of trialing various ones. 

When I finally  got my referral to the bulk billed pain specialist earlier this year, she immediately took me off Targin, switched me to Palexia (which didn’t help) then after my MRI results ordered steroid injections and x-ray guided facet joint injections which worked amazingly the first time - I was pain free for the first time which lasted 6/7 weeks. The next 2 sets of injections didn’t work (she said it’s a hit or miss) so she started me on Lyrica which I tried for 2 months and hated not to mention I gained about 7kg. I’m trying to lose weight since I’ve gone from a normal BMI to borderline overweight so I stopped it. Now she has me on Gabapentin and if that doesn’t work she will start me on Topamax. 

My pain is not being managed correctly and it’s causing me to self medicate. Please don’t judge me. 
I am hypermobile and it’s my belief that I suffered from a connective tissue disorder so I would like to see a rheumatologist to either diagnose or rule that out. It would explain so many other symptoms I have. 

Not sure why I am even writing this, just getting it out my system and seeing if there is anyone else out there in a similar situation. 
I have a child with Aspergers and the stress of that is a constant trigger for my pain along with cold weather, sitting and driving for long periods , excessive housework (I am OCD with cleanliness) and sleeping poorly. 

Also my pain specialist reluctantly prescribed 1 box of Endone a few days ago and told me to never ever take more than 1 x 5mg tablet. My doctor used to have me on 8 tablets a day so 1 tablet does absolutely nothing and the box is finished already. Is it insane she said no more than 1 tablet at a time? My mother in law, for example is on 80mg of oxycontin a day and Endone/Valium for breakthrough pain.

I was on morphine and oxy pretty much 24/7 for about a year after the surgery, and still need oxy daily to function.

587,Losing Hope,"Hello all,  


I'm new here. Today I just randomly googled 'reddit chronic pain' and was shown this subreddit. For two years what originally started as just migraines progressed into my left leg becoming paralyzed, losing all feeling in my foot, losing muscle mass and function on the left side of my body, and constant severe pain. I have been jumping through medical hoops for two years and it was only within the last five months that I've started to get anywhere with doctors. I have finally found a doctor that both takes the pain I am experiencing seriously, took 5x longer with me on the first visit, and has shown concern over the progression of whatever illness I seem to have. I went from a perfectly healthy functioning young adult that jogged 6 miles 3x a week to someone who can't stand without aid or sleep more than 2 hours every night.   


Medication costs are terrifying to me ever since I was started on a pain management program. Even with coupons and insurance two of my medications are over 300 dollars a month. I was scared to bring these concerns up with my doctor both because I feared to look like someone just seeking drugs and that I didn't want to be taken off of what relief I had found. Turns out he is a very caring doctor. When I brought up the money concerns with him yesterday he said he would simply find a medication that would be cheaper for me and he did just that.   


After two years of jumping through hoops I finally got a neurologist that took me seriously as well. She's one of the most caring doctors (or medical professional in general really) I've ever met. She called the man that is supposed to be one of the best neurologists for these sorts of things (my symptoms) and got me in six months faster than the timeline I'd been told when I'd called for myself.   


If anyone is interested this is how it all started for me... Ever since I hit puberty I've suffered horrendous migraines that occurred over six times a month. Two years ago I noticed my left foot started to hurt pretty bad (but at first it was just a minor annoyance, the pain gradually got worse). I went to my regular doctor and she said I must have injured it. She ordered xrays and sent me on my way. A couple of months later the pain started going up my leg and I began to lose muscle mass and function in my calf and thigh. I didn't notice the calf at first so when I was sent to a sports medicine doctor and diagnosed with a quad tear I thought nothing of it and did the prescribed physical therapy.   


The therapy did not work and a few months later my thigh had lost all of the function and mass in the outer area. I began to fall a lot (I've had three concussions in less than a year). Eventually I was sent to the neurologist that took me seriously. She had MRIs (with and without contrast) Lumbar punctures, EMGs, and blood work done. During this testing period I began to have issues with my left arm and the left side of my back was constantly spasming. She initially wrote a script for pain so that I would have some relief whilst she got me in with one of the (in her own words) best pain management doctors in my area. During this time she also diagnosed me with foot drop and noted my reflexes were 'dulled' on the left side of my body.  


Test results and imaging came back and she began to see it wasn't Lyme disease, MS, some sort of break or spinal cord compression, but she did note that my spine had lost 60-70% of the normal curve. My neck is completely straight. When she realized it wouldn't be something easily diagnosed and also realized she needed a diagnosis to start any treatment (even if she was 80ish% sure what she had in mind would at least help relieve some of the symptoms). That was when she made calls (that day she walked out of the room and went to make the calls herself) to get me in to see the specialist.   


By the time I'd lost most of my mobility I'd only lacked two semesters to get my dual degrees. This illness (whatever it is) has truly taken control of my life and robbed me of everything I was working towards.   


I sought out a place like this subreddit because no matter how much your friends and family love you unless they're experiencing something similar they won't understand. They won't understand the amount of anger, sadness, and frustration that comes with being 29 years old and unable to wash your own clothes, walk your dogs, or do anything that you once loved to do that required the ability to walk. They won't understand how your age works against you in getting severe pain taken seriously or to have symptoms and the loss of mobility taken seriously (I've had doctors tell me I'm exaggerating because of how healthy I was prior to all of this).   


They don't understand that there is no hope if doctors do not want to take you seriously. A life in constant agony and being unable to walk is no life. If we were anything other than human we'd be euthanized.   


My appointment with the specialist is this Monday. I am doing my best not to get my hopes up but I feel hope for the first time since I lost the ability to use my left leg.   


I suppose I just wanted to introduce myself and wanted to know (if that's okay) what are some of the things everyone else is dealing with in this subreddit as well as to vent. The 'opioid epidemic' has and will continue to cause chronic pain sufferers to not receive the pain relief they need for quality of life. I'm terrified that I'll end up back where I started before I began to receive medication for pain management.

My last interaction inspired me to give away the remaining items I have for sale in exchange for x hours of civic engagement. My emotions are off the chart due to me mowing my lawn for 2 days, cleaning, and having company.

I’m just wondering if anyone’s gone through this kind of thing because I need pain relief but I’d rather have control over my own medical treatment because if it’s in my parents name I cannot get anything from dispensaries and if i get questioned about consumption of marijuana (ie drug tests for jobs etc) the card wouldn’t be in my name so I’d have to rely on them to take care of it.

Following up from above.

Exhausted, just drove 3 hours out of state for a doctor to tell me STILL, I have lumbar issues. Turns out they found a minor minor minor disc bulge. I said that's cute. Send me to a THORACIC doctor. This doctor refused. Keeps saying I have no thoracic disc issues even when ON paper right in front of him it says I do. Disc protrusion etc etc.. mind you this was 4.5 almost 5 years agowhen I was still working. I told this doctor ""well work comp wouldn't have PAID me with a voucher to go back to school for a minor disc bulge homie"" and he just looked at me like a deer in headlights. Also told me my bulge wouldn't be causing my numbness tingling etc etc... well maybe my THORACIC disc is fool. It happens, it is rare but is happens when it degenerates into stenosis. Well... UCLA, john hopkins etc says so. What do I know I'm just a scmuck. Oh, he also upped my weight limit up to 30 from 20lbs... not that it matters, QME (work comp) trumps his opinion

I am really worried about my 6 year old protrusion..(6 years from accident not when last MRI was taken)

I am researching places to go still for out of pocket MRI no referral. I really really hope I don't have spinal stenosis.

Oh yeah, its  Work comp.  Too tired to type anything other than this.

P.S. Nerve conduction study came up fine.

This is from an email I sent my Case manager a few months ago:

QME repor states: 9/2/14 MRI demonstrated a new small left paracentral disc protrusion at T7-T\\8 which indents the thecal sac without clearly contacting the cord or narrowing the spinal cnal with a poissbly new tiny right paracentral disc protrustion at T3-T4 and unchanged appreance of small left paracentral disc protrurions at t5-t6 and t6-t7, which appears to contact the ventral cord without significant spinal canal stenosis.

596,Seattle pain docs? (Medicaid),"Hey all.

I got referral to pain management after having some complications from my endo/adeno surgery (PFD is pulling on my incisions and whatnot causing intense pain). Despite having chronic pelvic, low back, knee and thigh pain I avoided opiates for years. Now though, I do need something for my flare days or I'm just gonna be in bed all day. Not that that didn't happen before... Just now the pain is a whole other beast cause it's coming from mah guts and entirely unpredictable. 

Anyways!!! My surgeons office is asking where to send the referral to. But I want to make sure I go to someone who won't just try to say I'm fine and not continue the pain meds I was prescribed by my surgical team. I am on low dose (5/325mg) hydrocodone/acetaminophen which I take half of twice a day (so 1 pill/day). As I am past when my team prescribes meds (thus the referral) I am running short and have started taking ibuprofen everyday which does NOT cover my pain, but until I find a good Dr to help me manage my pain that's what I'll be doing! Saving the 4 hydrocodone pills I have left for aforementioned cant-get-out-of-bed days.

So yeah! If anyone knows of any doctors in Seattle that take Medicaid and do long term pain management, I'm all ears!!

599,My doctor told me my undiagnosed pain is really just mental anguish and that all I’m feeling isn’t real...,"It’s the first time I’ve been here after moving. I’m currently seeing a chiropractor, an auto-immunologist, and a doctor to treat my TMJ. All of them are fully convinced something in me isn’t right and the chiropractor has acknowledged it’s beyond weird. It started with my neck and sinuses, blurry vision and stabbing pains in the ears. Now it’s my entire body. I can’t even support my own weight when I stand. He thought the best course of action would be to have a test performed for Lyme Disease and sent me to a general practitioner. 

I got into her office and began with my array of peculiar symptoms. A couple of minutes in she hits me with a handful of questions obviously related to schizophrenia and then down a completely different path. She prodded into my history with depression and brought up my stay in a hospital after a suicide attempt a couple of years ago. When I broke down crying she pointed out that crying is what people do when they’re depressed. The thing is, as of a year ago I stopped all anti-depressants because I was happy. Turns out pain makes you cry too. Well she decided that’s not true, and states I should go see my psychologist. One of the best in the region who doesn’t even bother with insurance. Who I see every two weeks. Who also believes my pain. It was just fucking insulting. She wouldn’t even order the Lyme Panel for me. This is the second doctor in a year that’s told me I’m just imagining everything and that I look perfectly healthy. I wish this was all imaginary. 

Edit: Grammar and content

Thank you everyone for all of the support, it’s really reassuring. It’s hard not to loop what she’s said to me over and over, but I also know I have a ton of doctors coming up that will hopefully fare a lot better.

600,Patient Surveys; They probably shouldn't have sent me one.,"When doctors offices send out those requests to complete a survey... I'm betting they aren't expecting to get ones like the one I just filled out;

I pretty much rated her horribly at every catagory like ""how well do they really listen/how much do they care about your whole person/how helpful have they been"". 

Here's what I wrote in the comments; 
After four months of discussing the negative impact that a change in my long acting medication has had on my ability to function, my overall wellbeing, my pain levels and my quality of life; my husband &amp; I have addressed with the doctor my need to return to the previous dosage I was on because I am miserable, constantly in pain that is no longer adequately controlled, and we've been met by eye rolls, sighs, and being repeatedly told that ""our hands are tied"" or""It doesn't matter what the patients need or want, it only matters that we don't change or increase anyones opiod medications because we're not allowed."" 

For six years I was successfully managed on an unchanging dosage of long acting morphine for Ehlers Danlos Syndrome- an extremely painful, progressive condition that affects every part of my body. The only change to my medication in over six years was ME VOLUNTARILY reducing my breakthrough medication because I had medication left over each month. 

My doctor retired,a shady horrible clinic bought his practice, and I was dumped into a horrible practice where I never saw a doctor who knew anything about my condition, and they cut my long acting meds with no tapering, no notice &amp; most importantly-  no reason. Seven years of monthly visits, clean monthly drug tests and being a responsible patient clearly mean nothing. I asked to have my care moved to Cooper because all my other specialists are through Cooper; I expected the same level of care I've come to expect- instead, Ive repeatedly been shrugged off and told to go have a $100k pain pump surgery (even though the doctor who installs them has said that he doesn't believe I'm a ideal candidate). 

As a result of staying at this abusively lower dose of long acting medication- I'm dealing with an onslaught of symtoms that for six years, were mostly under control. I can't do 3/4 of what I could just a year ago- I've lost all my independence and I'm in pain and miserable 24/7.  I'm now at the mercy of my husband who works 7 days a week just to keep up with my medical expenses and my LAST surgery cost- as well as my 75+ year old parents and my 7 year old son-  who have to care for me, because I can no longer take care of myself, my home or my son.

 If I were a dog, I would have been put down. Treating pain patients as the scapegoats for junkies is disgusting and unacceptable.

 As I told the doctor this past month- I guess ""pain management"" isn't the right name for this practice. It's more like hospice... they're just waiting around for us to die off so they don't have to worry about prescribing medication to anyone, regardless of the conditions we're dealing with.  

Treating chronic pain patients as less than human is inhumane and completely unacceptable. Treating chronic pain patients as less than human is inhumane and completely unacceptable. It's unreasonable to refuse to acknowledge our concerns, to address what we're struggling with and to treat us as criminals because OTHER people abuse the medication that makes it possible for us to function and participate in life. It's unacceptable to have a patient tell you 'my life's not worth living like this"" and to roll your eyes in response. As a patient; we lose no matter what we do. 

At this point,  I almost expect retaliation for speaking up, but my voice is about the only thing I have left that still works.

I guess we'll see what happens. My guess; Absolutely nothing. ",
601,What liquor do y’all drink to get relief from the pain,,
602,Doctors make me question reality,"I get told a lot that I don't have any medical issue and there is something wrong in my head, that I have depression. 
It's true, I often cry at doctor's appointments, because my story is endlessly long and the doctor usually interrupts me, doesn't listen etc. And I just get so angry and nervous that I can't control my emotions anymore. I hate it, I absolutely hate it. Every emotion I show is automatically a type of disorder, that I am sad or angry cause I fight nearly every single day against an invisible enemy is just a completely unbelievable concept. Or that I am just sad cause someone broke my heart or I feel a bit alone (typical teenager stuff) is completely out of question. Do doctors even have emotions? I don't think so. So many doctors tell me to go to the psychodoc because I have depression, I am like one of the fucking happiest people in the world, I am just very sensitive also fucking depression doesn't cause muscle hardening, never ending cramps and eczema to just name a few.
Sometimes I have this moments where I just ask myself if I am real or not. If my whole life is real. I often really get the feeling people are not even responding to what I say as if I would say something completely different (mostly doctors but some other people to) and then I just get really out-weirded. And every time something weird happens I just tripple check how others respond to the situation. ",
603,The heat kills me,"Can't get out of my bed before afternoon cause blood circulation Is already slow but now it just won't allowe to get up, instant black out. Migraine of death. Bugs and flying disgusting things in every corner, biting me and cause my already weakend system to completly shut down. Constant paranoia and the feeling there are always a millions bugs on every inch of my body. Cramps like hell. Can't sleep properly. Exhausted. Fautige. 0 energy. Face hurts cause my skin reacts so bad to the heat and sweat that there was a whole fucking Cambrian explosion out of blood and pus. Digesting comes with deluxe crampes that make you want to never eat again. Every physical activity outside is impossible, even through the 6 layers of sunscreen, the sun feels like 3rd degree burns on my arms and legs. Any more spoonies who feel like the heat is slowly killing them? 
Edit; grammar",
604,Anyone who wilfully (on unwilfully) had success managing pain after ceasing prescription opiates?,"First off, I want to be very clear: I think access to prescription opiates while under a doctor's care should be a right no chronic-pain patient should be denied. I have perceived them as the only thing standing between me and permanent disability. I consider myself very fortunate that my doctor is still willing to prescribe the meds. I know many of you have been forced to taper or simply cut off. And that sucks.

Because, however, of (i) the current extremely hostile political climate and ignorance surrounding the use of physician-prescribed opiates among the chronic-pain community (and its ultimate impact on our ability to obtain prescription opiates); and (ii) the fact that I am metaphorically tethered to my pain-management physician, I have decided to (attempt to) stop taking opiates. This is a personal choice, and I do not believe anyone should be forced to do it, period. 

I have been using kratom for three weeks, which has successfully masked the typical withdrawal side effects. I've gone from 120 mg of oxycodone daily (both ER and IR) down to 20 mg, and from 20 mg of diazepam daily down to 5 mg. I hope to no longer be taking either medication by next week. The entirely predictable problem -- which everyone reading this knows is coming -- is that my localized chronic pain is nearly wholly unmanaged. And, of course, it's an exercise in futility to get off the medication only to find myself rendered effectively useless.

I'm 37, and for the last twelve years have dealt with advanced degenerative disc disease along all lumbar levels and severe lumbar spinal stenosis. Repeated disc herniations, sciatica (seriously, fuck sciatica), and all that fun stuff. My doctors tell me they use my MRIs to teach these disorders. So while it sucks being in pain to the point where suicide presents itself as a rational option, I can take satisfaction from the fact that my insides are memorialized in a PowerPoint presentation somewhere. 

So my question: Has anyone successfully transitioned from opiates to something else? Anything else? And, if so, what? I've been using CBD oil, which has helped some. My state is backwards and doesn't permit even medical marijuana, so that's unfortunately a no-go. 

If you've read this far, thank you. I appreciate your time, regardless of whether you have any suggestions. (And I welcome them all.) Internal spinal stimulator? Non-opiate medications, such as Celebrex? Punching walls (at the CDC)?

Much love, and I hope today is a ""good"" pain day for all of you.

August 8th, 9 AM in Texas State Capitol room E2.012

The charges relevant to us are Charge 1 and Charge 3, listed under ""Hearing Notices.""

Charge 1: Study the prevalence and impact of substance use and substance use disorders in Texas, including co-occurring mental illness. Study the prevalence and impact of opioids and synthetic drugs in Texas. Review the history of overdoses and deaths due to overdoses. Also review other health-related impacts due to substance abuse. Identify substances that are contributing to overdoses, related deaths and health impacts, and compare the data to other states. During the review, identify effective and efficient prevention and treatment responses by health care systems, including hospital districts and coordination across state and local governments. Recommend solutions to prevent overdoses and related health impacts and deaths in Texas.

Charge 3: Review policies and guidelines used by state agencies to monitor for and prevent abuse of prescription drugs in state-funded or state-administered programs. Include in this review policies implemented by the Texas Medicaid Program, the Division of Workers’ Compensation of the Texas Department of Insurance, the Teacher Retirement System, and the Employee Retirement System. Make recommendations regarding best practices.

We don't know what new legislation they're considering, but this is our only chance to get in on the ground floor and suggest what new laws should NOT do. My suggestions:

The Texas Intractable Pain Act has been a safe harbor to protect pain management doctors from disciplinary action, provided they use reasonable safeguards including pain contracts and random drug screens. We want that law kept in place. Targeting doctors for disciplinary action solely on number and dosage of prescriptions is effectively state-sponsored disability discrimination.

We also do NOT want to repeat the mistakes other states have made. Most importantly, no state-mandated MME dosage limits. It's not the job of government to dictate what dosage a licensed doctor prescribes to a legitimate patient.

Hope that helps, and hope to see you all there!

617,Feeling guilty about applying for disability. And also pretty scared.,"I'm turning 19 this week. So I figured what better way to celebrate my birthday then applying for disability?

Seriously though, I just sent all the documentation over today. My therapist suggested I apply for disability for a few reasons. Number 1 because my family is unable to afford my medical expenses. Number 2 because my home environment is very detrimental to my mental health (sure lots of you are familiar with that). I'm not going to list all of my conditions or anything cause I know how annoying that is. But I will say that I'm in debilitating pain 24/7 and am unable to socialize, sleep, or eat properly. I worked at a department store for three months last year and I almost killed myself during it. Everyone was pressing me to get a job which I why I tried. So these are the reasons I consider myself disabled. 

Anyway, there is a conflict going on inside me. Part of me understands that I'm disabled and am a prime candidate for this social security safety net. But the other part of me thinks I'm a lazy fucking leach sucking money from the federal government because I want to sit around all day. I'm speaking to my therapist about that soon hopefully. But ya anyone else feel this way? I just read [this](http://apps.npr.org/unfit-for-work/) article cause evidently I hate myself and it makes me feel like a leach. Am I really one of those people? That have a minor medical condition and are taking advantage of the federal government? I don't want to think I am. And part of me knows I'm not. 

Also the nature of how binding this entire process is really scares me. I'm having all kinds of last second doubts. Like, I'm repeating to myself, maybe I can work? Maybe I'm not in that much pain? Over and over again. And the entire social security application process was just very daunting tbh. Filling out federal paperwork as a 19 year old with little work experience telling some random person how incapable I am is scary. I read the giant warnings and they make it sound like I can never work again. I do want to work again! I don't want to be on my ass all my life obviously. Or at least I think its obvious.

I woke up and immediately knew right off the bat that it was going to be a *rough* day. I had a list from my parents of things they wanted me to do around the house and a dentist appointment to go to. I rested up until my appointment, knowing I was going to need all of my  strength to drive there and back. By the time I got back home, the pain was at a 9 verging on 10. I walked in the door and immediately crashed onto the couch where I laid frozen for the next hour. My mom comes home and sees the state I'm in, gets me pain meds (Tramadol 50mg - but she won't let me take more than 1/2 tab at a time- so really 25mg) and my heating pad..... but then she starts nagging at me for not doing the chores around the house. I tried to explain that I was in too much pain for the stuff she needed me to do, and she just got annoyed and frustrated.  After 45mins the pain medication started to kick in and the heating pad had helped a lot. Around the same time my boyfriend showed up to study with me. He carried me off the couch and to our study spot. I was smiling &amp; laughing since the meds had taken it down to a *much* more tolerable level ( plus duhhh, my prince charming just came and carried me away). This is when my mom said it.

""Wait, so were you just faking that before?""

I wanted to SCREAM!!!!! I have always wished that no one would ever have to feel the pain that I'm going through... except for that moment. I wanted her to feel that level 9 and level 10 SO badly. Show her that it's not all just an act. This is also coming from the woman who wouldn't let me touch pain medications for years until I had to go behind her back to get Tramadol and then had to work on getting her to accept it. So for years I had no ""off"" switch on terrible days. I just suffered.

Fine, but why does it only glitch with controlled substances (tramadol and clonazepam) and NEVER on non-controlled -- those all come through just fine? How long are they going to get away with the ""we're switching everything over"" dodge, since usually the bugs should be worked out in a few weeks?

Are they being told to do this to see how the person will react or as some kind of sick demented verification of whether they really have a condition or not? Is it like that thing where they put you through the whole ""we have to talk to your doctor"" bullshit first? For something you've taken for five years steady on the exact same dose without problems? Do they ever stop fleecing you like this?",Rx Cannabis is my salvation

622,Learning to Accept Pain (vent),"I went to the doctor yesterday (a rheumatologist). He is the 5th doctor I've seen this year and my last hope at finding answers to my joint pain that has been getting progressively worse over the past 2 years. This doctor was kind and sympathetic. He listened to me. But he said he couldn't find anything that was causing my pain and there was nothing he could do. When I got to my car, I cried. I was hoping someone could help me stop hurting, or at least tell me why I was. In a way, I felt silly for being so upset. If a doctor tells you there is nothing wrong, that's a good thing, right? But it's frustrating to be told you're fine when you really feel like somethings wrong. Sometimes it makes me feel crazy. 

When I got home, I told my dad about my appointment. He said he was glad nothing was wrong and that I just needed to accept that there was nothing they could do and move on. I agree, but that's a lot easier said than done. I am 22 years old. How am supposed to accept that I'm probably going to be in pain for the rest of my life and no one's even going to be able to tell me why?

I woke up this morning and my joints were on fire. I started crying again. I usually don’t cry from the pain. When I would have bad days I would usually just think about my next doctor’s appointment and hold on to the hope that they would be able to help me. But for the first time today I was dealing with the fact that maybe no one would ever be able to figure out why I’m hurting. And that sucks. I know I just need to accept that this pain is just part of my life. But I’m not sure I know how to do that. I suppose I’ll learn as time goes on.

623,I need to vent/ask for advice.,"I'm sorry the question might be simple but I'm having a bit of trouble concentrating and am feeling overwhelmed. Sometimes it helps just to jot things down.

I'm 28 years old and suffering from crohns disease. It's a quite severe case, I just had my crohn's disability hearing and the judge said it was the worst case she's ever seen and I was accepted that day. (yay a little stress gone)

I've tried almost every medication that is used to treat it in the united states to almost no relief. I'm using stellara + mercaptopurine right now which is helping some, but not nearly enough. I'm 5'6 105 pounds and male, I can barley keep anything down.

I've been taking #120 5 mg percocet for about 2 years now from my GP. It has helped but in the past few months it's not helping enough. A week ago at my last doctor visit he cut it down from #120 to #100. Didn't really give much reason why, just that he wants to try and get me off them? (hello i'm not in any less pain)

It makes me hate life a lot less and takes away some of the pain at least, but I will not be able to function without them. I could barley get by with 120 of them, I have no idea how i can do 100. I'll probably run out. (never ran out/had any problems in the entire two years I've been with him.)

I can't be bedriddened again. I already had to do that for a year while looking for a doctor that cared about my pain. I really can't do this again. I just want relief, I don't understand why I he's attempting to lower it/get me off them when I don't feel any better. Painkillers aren't going to kill me, but not having pain relief will. I might as well be dead because I'm not going to be able to do anything. I can't eat, sleep, or enjoy anything. All I can think about is pain, it's consumed every thought and every minute of my life. 

I googled some PM clinics around me but they all have 1-2 stars so I'm not sure they would be any better. So should I just attempt one anyway? Go back to the doctor and tell him I was unable to lower it?

I don't know what to do, I'm so overwhelmed. Thanks for reading. I would appreciate some advice right now. I'm really scared of having to go back to that kind of life again.",
624,Electric Shocks and pins/needles feeling in fingers and toes,"Hi fellow chronic pain sufferers,

   for the past month I've been experiencing severe electric shock like sensations and feelings of pricks (or like being stuck with pins and needles) **only in my hands and feet- particularly in my fingers and toes.**  The shocks and pricks come and go often with no reason- even when I'm just sitting. 

**For example, the shocks and pricks in my hands and fingers are often exacerbated in the hours after I've done any typing or writing (pencil/pen) or even basic daily activities that use small muscles of the fingers like opening and closing ziplock bags, pulling sheets of paper out of file folders and putting them back in, removing staples from paper, etc. At their worst the finger shocks and pricks are even exacerbated by holding onto a steering wheel of a car or typing a text message using the touch screen of my cell phone.**

What are your strategies to maximise the pain relief effects? 

Ideally I want to stop taking painkillers completely as I already have to take a high dose of oxycodone as it is and its ability to keep the pain at bay is not that effective and is getting less so every day.

Any helpful advice would be Fantastic!

627,Hoping to get some thoughts on what may be causing my nerve/muscle pain,"First, I am a 24 year old male, and 150 pounds and 5 foot 9 inches tall. Let me start by rewinding about a year ago. I was just about to start my last year at University as a computer science computer and as such I spent a lot of time sitting at a desk. At some point I started to notice a strange pain in my right hand while using my computer for long periods of time. I tried to take some breaks but it didn't really seem to get better. I also notice that my wrist seems swollen so I go see a doctor, they give me a talk about the dangers of carpel tunnel, give me a split and send me on my way. A few weeks go by and it gradually gets worse even with the splint. 


At this point I get referred to physical therapy. In my first appointment it becomes obvious that I need to work on my posture and so I start going twice a week to work on posture and my wrist. This was helping but I still felt like I was missing something. By winter break the pain in my hand and wrist is so severe I can't mouse, type, or write for more than 5-10 minutes and I have developed a stiffness in my hand such that I can't close my pointer finger more than half way. 


When I go home I immediately make an appointment with a wrist and elbow specialist. Suffice to say he was not very good. I did however get x-rays, an ECG from the elbow down and later an MRI on my wrist and forearm. Nothing shows up. He offers me steroid injections but I declined as I felt it would only treat symptoms, not the cause. I get a referral to a shoulder specialist who I see, get xrays, and am told again that nothing seems wrong. At this point I also started to get blood flow problems in my arm along with numbness, tingling, a burning sensation following the nerve down my arm and just pain in general. 


Feeling quite unhappy about my hand and future at this point I resolve to return to physical therapy and really put in a lot of effort to see if I can get anything else of out it. Upon a recommendation from my physical therapist I begin to see a chriopractor. At this point my physical therapist thinks that my symptoms are most likely originating in my shoulder and I just have atypical referred symptoms. We change our plan to reflect this. The chriopractor agrees with this and tells me he thinks I have thorasic outlet syndrome, and in particular my subscapular may be causing a lot of my greif. 


At this point I am doing several streches and exercises daily to help restore my posture and fix muscular inbalances. I notice my posture is getting better and symptoms are slightly better but nothing drastic. One night however I am sitting on the couch watching a movie. As a sit I'm stretching my shoulder blades when all of a sudden I feel a muscle in/under my chest release. I get an intense rush of blood and sensation my arm. 


Following this about eighty percent of my symptoms go away. My hand is no longer stiff and I can finally use a computer again. I'm elated. I continue to see my physical therapist for a while until she decides it's time for me to manage things on my own as I have progressed so much. I continue to see the the chriopractor a bit longer but eventually have the same conversation. Everything seems great. 


I finish school and move back home to help take care of my sick dad. At this point I had stopped doing the exercises and  progressed to frequent streching. This seemed to be managing everything well. Recently thing have gotten a bit stressful and I have been spending a fair bit of time at a desk as well. A few times I noticed a strange pinching in my right groin. I should note at this point that during this past year I had been feeling quite fatigued, had a lot of headaches that were strangely resistant to NSAIDs, and some stomach problems. I chalked this up to being stressed with school and was hoping I would feel much better with some rest after graduation. 


Well about two weeks ago I'm sitting at my computer and notice my arm getting cold. I take this as an early warning and start to stretch. The blood flow is restored quickly but pain and muscle stiffness returns. I stop using my computer and focus on loosening my shoulder. The stretching helps but it seems to be only giving temporary relief. Every morning I wake up stiff as wood, but my symptoms aren't terrible so I try to assure myself that I just need to get moving again and it should clear up. 


At this point I'm starting to get worried. Not only are my symptoms returning in a new way I also have a trip coming up which is already paid for. I'm hoping that I can manage everything till the end so that I can see another doctor and start seeing a new physical therapist and chiro at home.


The other as I get up to board my plane my right foot goes completely numb while I'm walking. I make it to my seat and by this time it has subsided everywhere except my big toe. Strangely enough there is one spot where if I apply pressure causes pins and needles and pain in the area. Everything else feels ok though. When I get to my hotel I spend a good bit of time stretching my shoulder hips and legs. This helps the feeling in my foot a bit. Through the next day I notice strange nerve twinging down my right arm and leg. 


Today I woke up and my right arm, particularly my right hand has a very dull numbness similar to what I experienced last winter. I can feel but it is significantly less pronounced than my left side. I have been stretching and my shoulder seems to have good mobility but nothing is giving me relief. 


At this point I don't really know what to do or what to think about this. I'm not sure if my leg is directly related to my arm or I am just incredibly unlucky to have two compressed nerves. I have had back pain before, particularly in one spot with a couple of spasm episodes, but it hasn't hurt recently so in question if that is the cause. My fingers were stiff for a while which has since resolved by with no change to my weird nerve pain/numbness. Since I'm on a trip I've been doing a lot of walking and I don't know if that could help or make this worse. If I move my legs or shoulders quickly or in a strange position I get shooting sensations down my nerves. 


Like I said I really don't know what to do right now and any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. Let me know if I can clarify anything and sorry for the long winded explanation. Thanks again. 

EDIT: thank you guys so much for the responses. I have been busy and haven't been able to respond to them but I hope to when I get a chance. I'm definitely going to be taking it easy, heading home, and seeing a doc/Neuro ASAP",

630,"Too long post, so sorry. Gotta vent","I appeciate anyone's good intentions, I do, but no advice needed, thank you. So...here goes. (and please, be gentle.) I have no one else to discuss this with openly, or to get these thoughts out. My wife is aware of most all of the following, and is doing everything she can (most amazing person ever, i don't deserve her) I love her dearly, but she is already upset enough and I don't want to tell her about some of the worst thoughts I had today. I've made this different account because every other thread I've attempted, I've been trolled, or made to feel worse from some a-hole that doesn't know me or what I've been thru at all.

I'm male, mid 40's. Had medical issues since my teens, BUT, In the last 4 years I've seen I can't count and can't remember how many doctors. Same goes with the number of surgeries (I know at least 15 surgeries. Have a bad back (herniated disc, other one bulging). Osteoarthritis. My orthopedic doc says I have the arthritis of a man in his 70s (all major joints, wrists, fingers, ankles,(from working manufacturing or very physical, super fast paced jobs my whole working life.), which i loved very much. I got HA MRSA was nearly fatal twice. I had HA c. diff and still deal with the aftereffect of both of them

Am now unemployed, due to extreme constant pain, and very limited mobility. (can't hardly walk, can't work with hand tools at all, can't lift over 10 lbs, cant even drive on a forklift, etc etc.) Even completely at rest, any position does not provide any relief. Talking long to type here my fingers dont work right so many typos and I have to keep taking breaks.

These issues in the last 4 years have caused me to lose 2 jobs, One of which I had been at for 10+ years, and fully expected ANDWANTED to be at until retirement. I had used my ST and LT disability coverage, on multiple occasions depending on the surgeries being done, for most of the surgeries. Hell there were a couple occasions I even used my own PTO for some minor ones. I explained with all my superiors (I was a manufacturing supervisor 2nd shift) upon my final return (which I hoped there would be no more surgeries needed, but there were...) that I would not be able to do all of the job duties I did before. I stated that I would be able to still carry out my management duties, but that all the physical things expected (filling in on production lines every day, frequently 2line positions at the same time, because they were too cheap to hire a full staff). 

any kind of state or Social Security Disability that was denied practically before I filed it is a fucking joke too but that's a whole other rant.

My superiors ""were"" completely understanding, and just sweet as could be over my once a week phone call or email updates to them, and not to worry, that it would not be an issue, just to get better and get back when I'm ready... UNTIL I got back. Id get the silent treatment from some every time. There was absolutely NO effort at any time for them to get the actual number of staff required to run full production every day, and after about 4 months of being back, I was forced out, because I could not do what they said I wouldn't have to do. Nothing was in writing, so yeah I got fucked hard there...

The other job was had after the surgeries after being forced from my awesome job. It was a little  bit easier but was physically unable there also. I was with them about 6 months.  i could have happily stayed there but resigned because i could not do the physical stuff

SO TO THE POINT. My hitting bottom.

That day was today. I had a major emotional, angry, crying, hysterical, yelling breakdown WITH my wife. (nothing directed at her, no argument or anything) but she was with me for this (I've tried a long time to spare her this emotional crap). And God Bless Her she cried for hours but was totally supportive and just let me get it out.

CLARIFICATION: I DO NOT WANT TO KILL MYSELF so kindly please save the suicide prevention links. 

Our benevolent government overseers, that always have our best interests at heart (YEAH RIGHT), and the doctors think opiates are the devil, won't give those, no no no!  which forces me to obtain any other means of pain relief wherever I can. and you know what, fuck the laws, fuck the risks. 

 I'm fucking pissed, I'm fucking sad. I have no more tears. they ran out YEARS ago. good thing my better half has enoygh for both us

I want to die! I want to die right this fucking second!. I don't care when, where, or how, just know that I absolutely will not be sad when my time comes. I am in pain 24/7. i wake up and pray to my asshole God to die, and agai n I pray to die when i sleep

 *But I love my wife and I promised her that I will not leave her of my own volition. It's the only thing I can give her*

I'm done with this world

 I don't want to do anything anymore, 

I don't want to go anywhere. 

I don't want to see anyone. 

there is no hope there is no joy and humanity are ONLY just ANIMALS doomed to destroy ourselves anyway look at the news look at the way people treat each other in real life there is no fucking point anymore

I just want to die so this fucking pain will stop.

631,I’ve been told by three different doctors that I should feel no real affects if I happen to stop this medication. Although if you look on chronic illness and chronic pain forums they will tell you how incredibly dangerous it is to abruptly stop this medication.,"I went three days without one of my daily medications because of a combination of brain fog, new pharmacy hours and OH YEAH the doctor never calling the medication in in the first place. Enter my usual symptoms magnified by 100, withdrawal symptoms (such as but not limited to severe shaking, spasms, blurred vision, shooting pains, weakness and falling down) and anxiety that could kill the chillest of folks. 

One of the things that’s really grinding my gears about the whole situation is this medication ( #cymbalta for those who are wondering) is supposed to have no withdrawal effects. This is not information that I googled, I’ve been told by three different doctors that I should feel no real affects if I happen to stop this medication. Although if you look on chronic illness and chronic pain forums they will tell you how incredibly dangerous it is to abruptly stop this medication. People have been hospitalized from the severe reactions very similar to what I experienced and I assume because it’s not only an anti-inflammatory and nerve medication but it’s also an anxiety medication, many people wrote about how their family members killed themselves while trying to get off the medication or in the time they were unable to receive their medication.

Last May I got pregnant, a pregnancy my husband and I were over the moon about. I had spoken to my rheumatologist prior to getting pregnant and she assured me that if I did get pregnant these medications (Cymbalta and #celebrex ) that it would be safe to come off them. Instead I had crippling physical and mental symptoms, my doctor said it was probably because of the pregnancy. Then I lost the baby. Then my immune system spiraled for the next few months. My doctor seemed surprised by the series of events but has since offered me additional medication (for other issues that happened as a result of all this) that she was also incorrect about how it would affect me. This also after telling me to “try and keep it together” because she didn’t think it was appropriate for my daughter to see me in so much pain 🤬🤯🤬#bitchbye

I’m not here to bash on medication, I can barely function throughout the day without my medication. Medication can be life or death for so many people and I am so grateful for these medications and the science behind them. My frustration is that we don’t get the whole truth about what we’re taking or worse, the doctors don’t know what will actually happen in these cases but assure us otherwise. Either way it’s irresponsible, it’s dangerous and I am tired of all the misinformation. I’ve been a guinea pig for 17 years and while most of the time I can find the glass half full, sometimes I wanna punch the glass in its stupid face. Is this something you’ve experienced with medication and a doctor not knowing the whole story about how it’ll affect you? Have you tried to come off these or other medications in the past and had similar experiences? Because if so, this is why we need to #shoutaboutpain because so many in the chronic illness and chronic pain communities go unheard until it’s too damn late. ",
632,Today: My Shower is the Enemy,"Today I feel like I was hit by a bus. As I open my eyes in bed the pain immediately rushes over me. I turn towards the clock and see I’ve only been asleep 3 hours. “Welp I’m not going to be able to fall back asleep”. So I decide I’m going to take a hot shower. As I get in the shower I feel like I used all of the energy my three hours of sleep allowed me to have. It hurts to move my arms, to bend down to get the soap that dropped, to think about washing my hair. Yet, I try to do it anyway. Eventually the pain is too great and I slump down to the bottom of the shower. I let the warm water bead on my skin as I sit there. Then the thought washes over me “how am I going to get up?”.  After twenty minutes of sitting, I muster the courage to attempt. I grab on to the railing and pull myself up. Any energy I had is now gone.  Today, the shower was my enemy. My chronic pain and autoimmune symptoms got the best of me.

635,My darkness,"You probably don’t know me. As a matter of fact, I am sure you don’t. Everyday I wake up I feel like I don’t even know myself. I am not the same person I was only a few years ago. Now most people would instantly think “a few years, well that is a lot of time for someone to have changed.” They would be right, though arguably not much has changed. At least for me. I have been dealing with chronic pain since my back injury all the way back in 2010. Eight years of pain has changed me in profound ways and not in an advantageous manner. These days I am less helpful to myself and everyone around me. I care less and less about human contact. When I do it seems the people, I want to see don’t care either. Which only pushes me deeper into my depression. Oh yeah, did I mention the depression? It is there, with me always like a shadow I can’t escape even in the darkest of nights. Those nights get very dark at times. I find myself wishing for death every so often. Even though I don’t really want to die. Death scares me. I just want to escape this pain. Both mental and physical. 

I have tried so many remedies for my pain, shots, therapy (physical and mental), multiple surgeries, medicine, so many “experts” I have lost track and the countless x-rays, MRI’s and CAT scans. I stopped counting after a dozen or so. Nothing has helped, and no one can tell me definitively what is causing my pain. They ask me the same questions again and again as if my answer is going to be different and I am going to solve the problem for myself. I wish it was that easy. Nothing for me these days are. From taking a shower, doing the dishes, bending over to put water on my tooth brush. Everyday tasks are a pain, literally.
 
No one quite understands. Who can if the “experts” don’t even understand. I am not bashing the doctors, but for people who think they are these magicians who are going to swipe their wand and make it all better are kidding themselves. I WAS one of those people. Needless to say, I was jaded. One could argue I still am, just on an entirely different end of the spectrum now. 

Yet, I still am here. Going to see these doctors in hopes one day I will be a portion of my older self. Because without some hope I don’t know where I would be right now. Really, I don’t know if I would be here at all. 

P.S. I am not looking for sympathy. I am not looking for anything if you’re wondering. I just needed to write this for me.

The thing that seems to bring me the most relief is deep tissue/hard trigger point release and massage type therapies (will make separate post).

I'm looking for tools and devices that I could use to at least temporarily relieve the pain (because I don't have the time and money to run to a massage each time), and perhaps that could even help me treat it long term.

- Foam rolling doesn't seem to hit the spots well enough
- Massage chairs neither

646,Most effective therapy for back/neck pain?,"(Again, If you see several posts from me at once, it's because I broke up my questions about chronic pain by the main topics)

This is a question for the best **therapy** (not tools/devices) for long-term relief, and not regarding the lifestyle changes (sleep/diet/exercise/stress relief/psychotherapy).

I've had (upper back, rear shoulder, neck, and lower back/hip) pain and stiffness for a while now. Everything kind of cracks and aches/has trigger points, especially after sleeping and during sitting/standing for a long time.

&amp;nbsp;

**The thing that seems to bring me the most relief is deep tissue/hard trigger point release and massage type therapies, like good quality Shiatsu massage and possibly myofascial release.** With these I actually feel that light and aligned feeling that seems to last for some time. 

Other things that I've tried that *don't* seem to bring longer-term relief:


- Chiropractic

- Physical Therapy

- Regular massage (swedish, hotstone, one advertised as ""deep tissue"")

- Accupuncture

- All the energy healing stuff

- Yoga/stretching

At first I admit that I was selfish and I didn’t understand his pain. I had the mindset of “it’ll just get better!” Or “he’s so young it can’t be THAT bad.” Which I know is like...horrible. Lately I’ve really been trying to be there for him and to be an understanding companion. He is often very upset/worried/mad because of his pain and so he’s not always the easiest to be around. What are some ways that I can make his life easier? Also, what are some things that I could say to him to encourage him? In other words, how do I respond to him when he’s upset about his body instead of just saying “I’m sorry”? I want to make him feel encouraged and loved and cared about. ",

653,I got an interesting compliment from my former manager,"At the company where I work, we have “strict” limits on work from home time. We’re not supposed to work remotely more than twice a month, which is really silly because I’m a technical writer and you can do that anywhere but whatever. Both my past manager and I have joint issues, so when I was navigating my first flare up at the job, we were totally in sync. I had unofficial accommodations to work from home as much as I needed during flare ups.

But they rotate managers every few years, and I’m getting a new one. 

We had a meeting with the three of us and I had totally forgotten about my previous health arrangements with my manager until the last minute. Literally we were all going to stand up and leave when I piped up and explained that I have chronic health problems with intermittent periods of serious issues. My old manager followed up with, “And dharmonie is very professional about her health. She always makes sure that if she’s overcommitted, she works with the team to identify high priorities and get coverage on anything else. She communicates her availability to everyone. Even when things are out of control, she’s got it handled.”

It just felt so validating to have a leader acknowledge that my body is unreliable but I’m not. I’ve never had someone speak highly of how I handle my health. Sometimes I feel like a burden or a weak link in the team because I need more help or I can’t pull my own weight during a flare. It’s a huge amount of insecurity, and I needed that compliment so badly for all the times people made me feel like because of my pain, I wasn’t dependable.

Anyways, I didn’t know who else to share this with. I’m going to miss that manager so much. ",chronic migraine/ EDS?
654,SO has had a headache every single day for 17 years. Need guidance.,"Hello,

I am hoping there is somebody here who can help or point me in the right direction.

When my husband was around 10, he was hit in the head with a brick from the roof of a 2 story house. He was knocked out, but his parents had a MRI done and they said ""he has a hard head"" and was cleared. A bit later (he remembers it being close to being hit in the head), he started getting headaches. He complained to his parents but they just gave him some aspirin and didn't really do much. When we was about 18 they started getting so bad that his mom took him in for another MRI to rule out a brain tumor.  Nothing on that MRI, either. 

Fast forward to today: He gets headaches every single day. There is not one day where he is not in pain. He keeps a chart of his pain every day and it's typically a 4 or 5/10, sometimes going up to 7 or 8. He has seen a neurologist and has been on a ton of different medications: Topomax,  indomethacin, topiramates, probably more that I'm not thinking of. Nothing helped and they all had horrible side effects (psychological). He even did a round of botox and that did nothing. He has seen a headache specialist, and is currently seeing a jaw specialist who fit him with a mouth guard that he wears every night. Most recently, we both went on a migraine elimination diet. We have both been eating nothing but chicken, brown rice and green vegetables for a month. He noticed a slight improvement in the beginning but now it's back to normal. Keto is next on the diet front. 

We really just want a diagnosis. There can be so many causes of headaches but how many things can cause a daily headache for over 10 years?  Do we try different neurologists? Go to a neurosurgeon? I am thinking that it must have to do with the brick of '01 but who knows? Anyone ever gone through something similar and found relief? ",

I have never done Heroin.

However, when I picked up my new pills from the pharmacy 3 months ago, they seemed extremely more potent than usual but the dose, manufacturer, and the look of the pill are all the same. I used to take 1 whole pill a day, but because I was getting extremely hot and feeling weird/uncomfortable after I took 1, I was taking 1/2, then 1/4, now I've gotten down to 1/8 of a pill.

The other night, I took 1/8 of the 1 whole pill because I was having extreme pain, and I started having uncontrollable muscle movements. My body started shaking and couldn't calm down. I stopped them immediately after that reaction scarred me, and haven't touched a pill in 2 days. I now feel like I have the flu. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

672,The Absurdity is Spreading!,"Just a very short note about some happenings in the last week or so

    1) A major US news bureau recently broadcast a story about how anti-anxiety meds were the""new"" opiate ""crisis--truly I wanted to vomit!  
Even more so when a ""professional"" woman was interviewed in the same story and said , ""Anti anxiety medications aren't a new version of the opiate crisis---they have been just like the opiate crisis for some time now.""  ---this paraphrased of course but the exact same gist of her quote. 
 So get ready for a massive pile of BS all of those who rely on these meds for a decent life!  I was taken off Xanax in early 2017 after being given a far too short timeline to cut down and quit.  I became an instant insomniac---a nervous one at that!  Then i was put on a sub par ""substitute"" for the Xanax called Atarax which I really can barely afford, whereas the Xanax (alprazolam)cost $2.35 a month with my insurance.

    2) I was put on Cymbalta (duloxetine) in 2016 when they started making massive cuts in my pain meds.  I responded very well to this anti-depressant with no problems and a very quick settling on the proper dose for me.  I missed ONE appointment recently due to pain.  But i quickly made another appointment with the psychologist for a mere two weeks later.  She renewed my Cymbalta for some days but not enough to cover me until the next appointment.   Why did she even bother?  My understanding with these meds is that you can't miss doses for them to work correctly and I  have no 'addiction' issues with this med period!

  tl;dr. I am getting so fed up with all of these ridiculous new regulations, whipped up hysteria , sheer stupidity and cowardice that I waver all the time between wanting to bash my head against a wall and seeking a ""solution"" on the ""streets"" which I really wouldn""t have the first idea how to do because guess what? I've never done this type of thing in my life and have only used meds legally prescribed for REAL conditions!

683,Info I found in the comment section of BCBS anti opioid add on fb.,"I'm going to post those statistics that those of you who know me, know that I am so incredibly fond of. 😁

I studied the information, wrote this, and cited the sources. Feel free to save and share!

Less than 4% of legitimately prescribed, opiate/ opioid treated patients, went to using heroin.

Of Chronic Pain Patients:

Around 1% of those patients, prescribed opiates/ opioids, without a history of drug and alcohol abuse, became addicted to opiates/ opioids.

Around 10% of opiate/ opioid treated patients WITH a history of drug and alcohol abuse, became addicted to opiates/ opioids.

Alcohol makes up the largest segment of drugs abused, misused, and of addiction.

Alcohol has around 244 deaths per day, whereas all opiates/ opioids, are under 100 deaths per day (In The US).

Less than 20 in every 100,000 persons in the US, have overdosed on all opiate/ opioid drugs, which is .02% of the population.

There are around 23.5 million addicts in the US (all drugs and alcohol), 2.6 million of which are opiate/ opioid addicts, whereas there are around 100 million individuals suffering from severe, intractable, chronic pain.

There are 323.1 million people, in the population of the US.

Opiate/ opioid addicts make up an extremely small minority of our population!

Most Chronic pain patients utilize many treatments- alternative, injections, surgical, PT, massage, tens unit use, OTC drugs, other RX drugs, in addition to opiates/ opioids.

There are people in severe pain, with no quality of life or function, without their medications and treatments, which should be decided by their doctors (not doctors under duress, as they currently are.)

The biggest indicators for substance abuse and addiction are:

1. Childhood abuse/ trauma
2. Poverty/ unemployment
3. Co occurring mental health disorders

Now even though the pain is worse they have to cut back my medication so I am back to crying all the time.  I have no quality of life and my poor family is stuck around me.  I want to know are they going to start assisted suicide for chronic pain patients since they are taking away our medications.  I know they, the government, knows more about my doctor, but they have no solution and don't care.   Like today I can't get it filled even though I'm supposed to be grandfathered in and have to wait till monday for them to call the doctor.  Every month they do this and I end up crying in pain till they do fill it.   They look for every excuse not till fill it and could care less about the patient.  It seems like they would prefer suicide rather then deal with chronic pain patients.  I feel like I am running out of options and I am so tired of crying and being miserable.  I have to go back to work since my husband lost his job and don't know what to do.  I can't stand or sit more then 20minutes at a time.  I used my tens machine nonstop even though it does nothing.

691,Newbie! Hope I’m not breaking any rules!,"I thought I’d introduce myself and hopefully find other people/women who struggle with the same things I do. I promise this is a chronic pain post, bare with me.

I’m 21 years old and am in the midst of being diagnosed after searching for 7 years. My medical team, my family and I are almost certain it is Multiple Sclerosis, pending MRI, as I have had an abundance of neuro issues the last year or so. I trip and fall, drop things, forget odd things like entire conversations, my entire left side of my body will become extremely weak where I am unable to even lift my arm to wipe my eye, I get these electric shock pains in my head and neck, I get temporary blindness or blurry vision, and I now have tremors in my hand and knee. But what I have struggled with since 14, is the fatigue and the absolutely crushing PAIN. Most of my symptoms come and go (although each time they come back they are worse), but even when I’m in “remission” the pain is never lower than a 4. It causes insomnia. It keeps me immobile often. And the worst part is that I cant help but feel like a burden to my family. There are so many things that I’m just not able to do sometimes. Sometimes I cant pick up my own son or make my own food. I want to ask for help to get into and out of the shower or to get out of bed or off the couch but I always chicken out. My family has always called me dramatic so I actively avoid situations where they might call me so. Not that my family isn’t kind and supportive, it’s just that I think after 7 years they have “compassion sickness”. 

I try to push through as much as I can, especially for my son. But I am just so tired and hurting so badly. Tonight nothing seems to help this horrible back pain.

704,Bulging disc help?,"I'm a few years shy of 30 and became sedentary after partially tearing (I felt a ""pop"" in each hamstring and they bruised immediately) both my hamstrings playing sports. I was young and stupid and had crap health insurance so I never rehabbed them correctly.

A few months after the injuries, I started dealing with sciatic/hip/lower back pain on my left side. This has lasted now for almost two years. I have been to chiros, PTs, general practitioners, massage therapists--the works. I am unable to bend forward at the hip without excruciating pain on my left side (I can only bend down now by keeping my back straight and lunging; I've actually switched to shoes that don't require socks so that I don't have to deal with bending too much each morning).

I recently had an MRI done which indicated a bulging disc at L5/S1 and a less severe one at T12/L1. The L5/S1 area is definitely where I feel the most pain.

Because I'm afraid of doing the wrong exercises, I have basically reset my routine and am now only walking while doing the McKenzie press-ups/yoga cobra pose 3-5 times per day. In a few days, I will be getting an inversion table which I hope will help.

I've scoured the internet for many, many hours of the last two years, but I haven't asked yet asked other people for their input on my specific issue.

If you've experienced a similar issue (L5/S1 bulging disc with pain on a specific side of the body), how did you heal it? What exercises should be used &amp; avoided?

705,Finally Found a Great Doctor,"Yesterday, I had to go to a Dr’s Appointment. I’m sure I’m not the only one to get bad anxiety when faced with a Drs appointment. The feeling of knowing you have to describe symptoms that they have never experienced or can sympathize with.  I have been seeing my doctor for about 4 years now. In fact, he got me on the road to my neurologist and my diagnosis of Trigeminal Neuralgia and fibromyalgia. He has been really great about getting me pain relief for those two diseases. 

A few months ago my neurologist ran some MRI’s on me and ordered a Lumbar Puncture. It turns out I have Multiple Sclerosis. I have had it for years and no one figured it out. It was masking it self as fibromyalgia. Now, I have been on and off several pain killers and opioids over the years. But now as we all know we have no access to those pain killers anymore. Even my neurologist says there is nothing he can do to help me except for the run of the mill neurological meds he prescribes. He is not a bad guy, he just doesn’t want to go to jail. Understandable. That’s a whole other rant. 

Back to my regular doctor. So I show up to my appoint and explain to him my severe pain and I tell him what My numerologist said. He is quiet for a while and I’m thinking fuck- I’m shit outa luck and it’s just gonna be a game of how much longer can I endure this. Then to my surprise he says, well I can’t let you suffer. That’s wrong and I won’t let you suffer. He then maps out a pain plan for me and surprises me with some really helpful meds. He says we will both have to be careful as he doesn’t want either one of us to go to jail. I will have to take the stronger pain pills only when I need them. I Almost Cried and the relief I felt was overwhelming. There are still good doctors in the US.  I think there are more of them than we as patients think, but they cannot act for fear of going to jail. 

So I go to the pharmacy to pick up my medication and the pharmacist gives me hell. He actually calls my doctor to confirm it and then shames me for taking them. He gave my doctor attitude as well. I gave him the business, but I was afraid in the back of my mind he might turn my doctor and I in. Don’t get me wrong these are not super strong meds nor is it a big amount I’m getting. I’m also clinically diagnosed with severe MS. I felt like I was facing the, Gestopo. What is our country turning into? Has anyone had a similar experience? I wish all of you good health and happiness.

August 8th, 9 AM in Texas State Capitol room E2.012

The charges relevant to us are Charge 1 and Charge 3, listed under ""Hearing Notices.""

Charge 1: Study the prevalence and impact of substance use and substance use disorders in Texas, including co-occurring mental illness. Study the prevalence and impact of opioids and synthetic drugs in Texas. Review the history of overdoses and deaths due to overdoses. Also review other health-related impacts due to substance abuse. Identify substances that are contributing to overdoses, related deaths and health impacts, and compare the data to other states. During the review, identify effective and efficient prevention and treatment responses by health care systems, including hospital districts and coordination across state and local governments. Recommend solutions to prevent overdoses and related health impacts and deaths in Texas.

Charge 3: Review policies and guidelines used by state agencies to monitor for and prevent abuse of prescription drugs in state-funded or state-administered programs. Include in this review policies implemented by the Texas Medicaid Program, the Division of Workers’ Compensation of the Texas Department of Insurance, the Teacher Retirement System, and the Employee Retirement System. Make recommendations regarding best practices.

We don't know what new legislation they're considering, but this is our only chance to get in on the ground floor and suggest what new laws should NOT do. My suggestions:

The Texas Intractable Pain Act has been a safe harbor to protect pain management doctors from disciplinary action, provided they use reasonable safeguards including pain contracts and random drug screens. We want that law kept in place. Targeting doctors for disciplinary action solely on number and dosage of prescriptions is effectively state-sponsored disability discrimination.

We also do NOT want to repeat the mistakes other states have made. Most importantly, no state-mandated MME dosage limits. It's not the job of government to dictate what dosage a licensed doctor prescribes to a legitimate patient.

Hope that helps, and hope to see you all there!

4 months ago my grandma passed away and my mom went to Our country to organize the burial and fix all the documents regarding heritage and what not. Everything in 1 week. She's very hard working so naturally she made it, it was 24/7 non stop work between organizing the burial and fixing the documents but at the end of all of that, when she started to relax, she just collapsed, unable to walk and move her neck.

Docs said that it's due stress and prescribed pills to relax her. They kinda work but she's always sleepy and doesn't take them. She's much better now, she can walk and do normal stuff, but she's still unable to move her neck without acute pain and has to wear a neck stabilizer.

Seeing that this isn't going away and doc's weren't helping that much, she did a MRI to check it out and here're the results, maybe someone could suggest the best action to take? I love my mom and want the best for her.

725,Doctors won’t listen because of my age. I’m at my wits end and need treatment.,"I apologize as this will be long and drawn out but I have really exhausted my options and need advice from people like me. I’m 25 years old and I’ve been dealing with chronic pain for the majority of my life. 

A year and a half ago I started experiencing back pain worse than ever before, so much so I can barely walk some days and have been seeing doctor after doctor since. They won’t listen. My family doctors brushes me off and sees no problem with me taking six 650mg acetaminophen and various NSAIDs every day with no relief. I’ve tried PT, acupuncture, TENS therapy, herbal remedies, etc. I live in an area of the country where pain medicine is extremely controlled and there is a lot of drug abuse. 

What I want to know is how to assert myself and make a doctor listen to me and do something. I’m shy and as soon as they start saying that maybe it’s just fibromyalgia and I need more sleep or something, I just back down. I’ve gotten treatment for muscle spasms before but I’ve been experiencing pain since I was a child and never really sought treatment. I just deal with it.

My diagnoses relating to pain are chronic migraines, thoracic outlet syndrome, moderate thoracic scoliosis, spina bifida occulta, flat feet, Marfan’s syndrome and arthritis. I have one extra vertebrae. I test positive for autoimmune arthritis but doctors
ignore it despite the titer increasing each year. I don’t understand how they can say none of this can cause the level of pain I’m in.",

Eight months later in May of 2013, the same disc ruptured and I had yet another microdiscectomy. Due to the back to back nature of the surgeries and pain management my medications escalated to 30mg oxycodones 4x daily. By April of 2014 I was off all opiate pain medication for chronic pain and other than short term narcotics for my csection in 2016 I haven’t been on any pain meds. Well last month I went to my PCP with worsening hip pain and right butt pain. This isn’t my first rodeo with nerve pain and I knew the MRI would be bad. Sure enough, I have a THIRD rupture if L5-S1, but need to have a fusion this time. I am in the process of getting in with a neurosurgeon. 

So I am in a lot of pain. I completely respect what the government is trying to do with the opiate crisis. What confuses me is that my PCP says he can’t give more than a weeks rx of pain meds yet the prescription isn’t a weeks work based on the dosage and frequency (which I am not taking it that often). A don’t abuse narcotics, never have and never taken more than what’s prescribed but to ask for pain meds, I am being made to feel like a junky. If I took the current script like prescribed it would last 3.33 days. I am stretching it out at least 10 days. 

I am just venting and confused. When did asking for pain meds in light of genuine, documented and verified reasons for said pain, make us abusers? I have been with this doctor for several years so he knows me and knows that I am not one to ask for narcotics. Frankly opiates scared the hell out of me after what I went though back in 2013-2014 weaning off of them. I am on Gabapentin starting the slow increase of medicine. ",

● Comments are due by July 30, 2018. 

On August 2nd, the Health Evidence Review Commission (HERC) and it’s subcommittee Value-based Benefits Subcommittee (VsBC), will be submitting their proposed changes to Medicaid to discontinue long term opioids for chronic pain and fibromyalgia. The changes include a forced taper for ALL chronic pain patients on opioids, NO exceptions. Opioids will be replaced with mandatory alternative treatments (only 30 visits per year combined), cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and treatment with non-opioid medications, such as NSAIDS, Acetaminophen, and muscle relaxers.

If you don’t have Medicaid, and are not a resident of Oregon you may be thinking you’re in the clear and have nothing to worry about. Nothing could be further from the truth!!! When these policies go into effect in Oregon, every insurance company will follow suit. WE know how this works....Anything like this will be used to set a precedent for other states. 

Share this everywhere, please! Twitter, Social media, etc...

They have tried to make this as confusing as possible, but to help make it easier here are some tips for creating your comment: 

● Comments are limited to 1000 words. 
● You should put VsBS in the subject line of the email for your comment to count.

1. Include your conditions and the date they started. Keep it simple, just the diagnoses.

2. Include if you are currently on long term opioids, do explain how they improve your daily life and functions. An example would be that before your opioid therapy, you were unable to work or care for your family, but now that you are on the opioid therapy, you are able to to do those things.

3. If you’ve been forced off opioids, explain how your quality of life has been negatively affected.

4. List any alternative treatments that you’ve tried in the past and how they worked for you.

5. State how policy changes will affect you. What will your life be like and how will it not only affect you, but your family, friends, neighbors.

2. Nausea: usually caused by bloating, sometimes comes on it’s own. Very debilitating
3. Body aches: similar to how I feel with the flu. I feel like I ran a marathon after a 4 hour work shift
4. Fatigue: again, feels like I have the flu. Very tired but not “sleepy”
5. Eye sensitivity: not sure how relevant this is but I can’t drive without sunglasses unless it’s past 8:00. Sunlight hurts bad.
6. Brain fog: when the fatigue kicks in, my brain feels “slow” and “foggy”

I’ve had the following tests: gastric emptying scan, ultrasound, endoscopy, colonoscopy, blood test, SIBO test, Celiac and lactose test, and anorectal manometry.

All were normal.

I have another GI appointment soon, but I’m wondering if anyone had advice about the non GI symptoms (which none of my doctors are taking seriously).

*This is not mine. I've borrowed it from the pain group. It deeply touched me reading it. I hope it touches you too and that you might consider joining the rallies. Idk if the rallies will help...but the govt needs to see us and see that we are real people, not drug addled, drug seeking people that can't form a sentence.. Not enough of us are committed.*


When the Medical Board revoked Dr Merrill’s license for over prescribing pain medicine, then the DEA arrested him, the arrest shocked the medical community. Drs became scared to see his patients, abandoned patients suffered pain, withdrawal symptom even some such as Mr. RP, after a number of doctors refused to treat him came home and put a gun in his mouth and committed suicide. This is utterly intolerable in a civilized community. There should be no person ever be put in the situation where he or she is suffering so much pain, that he or she chooses self-inflicted death over the agony being endured.  Senate report HR2260 P. 82T .  I was fiercely patriotic and took my oath to defend the US constitution seriously (patients have a constitutional tight to palliative care) and to prevent more tragedies, my conscious, Good Samaritan law ordered me to treat them by prescribing the minimum effective dose,After all. Our fears should not interfere with our obligation.

Two of my patients that I loved, both died as a result of investigating me (A. T &amp; D.P). Drs were afraid to write them their vicodin prescription, instead sent them for risky and savage surgery (Hip replacement and spinal surgery) to relieve their pain, it cost tax payers hundreds of thousands of dollars, both went to the hospital walking, both left by their dead bodies being carried to the Morgue, and their souls went screaming to the high heavens questioning who the actual killer was.   

I want  the DOJ and law enforcement as well as the patient to know the law that I sent you, Please publish it. Ignorance in the law cause unnecessary pain and suffering and deaths, I will try to call you next week,
 thank you for your response and keep up the good work.

751,He quit me because of Macys.,"Welp. My fears were confirmed this morning. I met with my pain management doctor and he said he couldn’t do my day-to-day pain medicine anymore because of the interference from Macys. My adjuster at Macys has apparently been sending him and his office “love letters” telling him to stop my treatment, don’t prescribe any more narcotics, etc and it freaked him out. I guess it implied that they could sue him for malpractice. 

I get it, it’s his practice on the line and he has a family to look out for, but this fucking sucks ass big time. He recommended another doctor but Macys could fight that (and given their history...) and the judge could deny it. I can’t believe that this is okay though. I told him to follow the court order and not the love letters, but he still said it was just too convoluted and complicated to handle. A third party (my Macys adjuster(s)...) getting in the middle and trying to dictate his practice gets too much in the way of the doctor-patient relationship, he said. 

How is this okay. How can they (the people at Macys) live with themselves for treating me this way? It boils my blood and makes me cry at the same time. I can’t wait for this shit to be over...but even then I know I may have to deal with them on some level for the rest of my life for this chronic pain. My heart just hurts. ",
752,Chronic Pain and the Final Solution,"I have been suffering from chronic pain since December of 2001. It started off with knee-pain. I went from one doctor to the next to find out why I had such bad pain that I could not stand on my left leg. ""Its in my head"" most of them told me, or I am looking for drugs. In the summer of 2015 I was diagnosed with Disk De-generative Disease. For 14 years not one doctor ever checked my spine for a source of my pain. 20 17 had my L4 L5 S1 laminectomy. Solved nothing. Now I am waiting to see the Surgeon again end of next month. My family physician kicked me out two months ago and sent me to a ""pain specialist"". They told me that they don't give out pain meds in the amount my family physician was giving me till than. And he never seen anyone not being able to walk with my condition.                                                                  

Anyway,,, I think I figured out what is going on with chronic pain treatment in the USA. The first chance a doctor gets will kick you out. You end up in pain from what ever you got AND withdrawals just to give it a little twist. In my case I have two options: wait to die in the most horrible pain, or go to a methadone clinic every day for as long as I live. If I die society doesn't have to worry any more. ""CASE CLOSED"". If I go to a methadone clinic I ""ADMIT"" that I am addicted to pain pills and I get what I deserve. Also probably end up loosing my disability. Again ""CASE CLOSED"". I stopped tacking morphine 1.5 months ago. The pain specialist told me I will be in pain from the pain meds for about 2-3 months before it will get better. If, it will get better.  ",

When I have many days with severe tension I usually get bad headaches. I've not been diagnosed with anything yet, but I plan on seeing specialists. I have a very hard time getting information on the possible causes and treatments off the internet because most people experiencing this kind of problem have some kind of anxiety, stress, or negative thoughts associated with it. I don't experience much stress, I am pretty satisfied with my life and I don't have much self esteem problems so I don't know where this tension is coming from.

758,How to listen to your body when you no longer trust it?,"Hi everyone!

I'm really struggling currently with the way my pain/pursuit of treatment has screwed up my ability to trust my body. I have had so many different opinions from different doctors, some who say that my pain makes sense, some who say that it is totally unexplainable. There has also been a big emphasis on how my mental state effects my pain, which I don't buy into all that much but it's still twisted me up. Now whenever I feel any kind of pain, it's like I can't trust whether it's real or not. It's hard to describe. Does anyone else experience this? Also if I feel fatigued or run down, I can't tell whether it's a real symptom or me being lazy... 

My doctor said it's important I get back in touch with listening to my body, but I'm having trouble. Does anyone have any tips on how to put aside all the many many opinions and just focus on what my body is telling me?

For context, I have lower back pain, which varies in levels depending on my activity. I've had it for 7 years and over those years it steadily got worse. I get nerve pain down the leg. I also feel very fatigued and weak all the time, but I don't know if that's just from being tired of dealing with a pain condition or if it's part of the condition. I have degenerated discs but doctors don't feel like the pain matches the amount of damage in my back. I do physio/pilates, daily exercises, daily meditation, neuroscience exercises to try to retrain my brain, but I have not improved. 

I'd so appreciate just hearing from anyone who feels like they struggle with the same thing. It honestly feels like my brain has changed and no longer knows how to process things anymore. ",

My wife is getting tired of it all. I dont know if we'll last. It breaks my heart.

I was physically addicted to pain meds until I went to the sweat lodge. Now I am on 1, 10mg oxy which I break in half and take one half in the morning and the second half at night. 

I am still in debilitating pain. Extremely physically restricted, pain pain pain.

766,Epidural steroid injection for centralized back pain?,"Hello everyone! I'm 24 years old and i have mild desiccation of the L4-L5 disc and a mild bulge of the same disc, so mild in fact that it took a few different docs to look at my MRI before they noticed that their was a slight bulge. Despite my MRI being seemingly unremarkable, I have had functionally limiting back pain coming up on 7 months now. occasionally i have tingling in my left foot and some very mild pain in my left calf but besides that, the pain is pretty much centralized in my lower left back. I've been in PT for about 4 months now, and that has helped a little bit but my pain management doc wants to try an epidural steroid injection to help with pain and hopefully speed up my progress in PT.

 Does anyone have experience with ESI with pain that was largely centralized in the back and not shooting pain down the legs? ",

768,Screwed by Walgreens again,"I switched a couple years ago to Walgreens because Target was having stocking supplies I'm guessing because of the whole legal issue they had. But as soon as I switched Walgreens refuse to fill the amount that my doctor prescribed for me on my perks. Luckily I had already self tapered and I was able to go down to the 180 a month that they would only Max fill.



I always plan ahead and request a refill two days in advance to get my doctor plenty of time just in case she isn't there to fill my scripts. So I did the same thing this month and when I went to follow up with Walgreens on the day that I'm allowed to pick them up wondering why it wasn't done yet or when it would be done they told me they were waiting for a taper down plan from my Dr.  And that was the second answer I got they didn't even want to tell me this to begin with. First the tech tried to tell me that there was something wrong with the wording of my script and that it was funny and they were getting clarification. So I said back to her well that's funny it's been the same exact wording for the last 2 years that I've been getting this script and I've not had an issue about it before. So that's when she got the pharmacist on the phone with me and when they told me the truth. I was so so pissed. I told her that I've been a customer there for a couple of years and that they had plenty of notice to let me know about this so that I could handle this and yet nobody said anything to me.


Then I get any email from my doctor saying that she wants to reduce me 30 pills a month until she gets me down to 3 pills a month to follow this new CDC rules and recs. I wrote her back and explain to her that I often try self tapering and that I actually get pain relief from these meds but that I was willing to try and if we could slow it down. Luckily she was willing to only go down by 15 month but I'm really scared if I can't do it then what am I supposed to do?

Nobody has been able to find out why I have the pain that I do. It was initially endometriosis which I had thought I resolved but the pain came back even after surgery. I've had multiple surgeries exploring trying to find out what's going on in my pelvis. I've even been to a GI doctor to see if I have Crohn's. I did have one dock say that she thought I had overactive nerves because I have had two previous C-sections. So I've basically been living with this generic label of pelvic pain and treated like an addict for needing to take medicine that helps me function.

 It continues to amaze me that these rules are driving medical practices and medical decisions because of these pharmacies. I'm so stressed out about not being able to taper down and mostly getting the pain relief that I need. I've literally tried everything. I live on a heating pad in bed sometimes. I have a TENS unit. I've piggybacked other anti-inflammatories. I'm just at a loss and I'm tired of this pain running my life and not being able to live my best life because of it.  Sometimes I just want to sit down and curl up in a ball and cry in a room all by myself for hours.

I'm really sorry for the super long post but I really really needed to vent and I don't have anyone I trust enough to vent about this to. I hate hiding the fact that I'm in constant pain and that I have to take medication for it. For anyone who lasted all the way to the end of this long-ass post thanks for being there. Obviously I'm definitely switching pharmacies. I'm even considering switching to a small mom-and-pop shop even with their Limited hours I feel like I'll actually get treated like a human being and not an addict.",
769,Count me now,"Count me as one of the many who have told they're cutting my dose to 1/3 of what it is today. I have 2 days to taper.

I'm terrified, upset. I have 2 kids and these medications have allowed me to have a life. Without them I don't know what I will do.

770,Probably going to have to come off pain killers.

771,My doctor decided to cut off my painkillers today,"My doctor has decided to dump her chronic pain patients and take on a career in addiction medicine instead. There's tons of junkies in my area, so it's super profitable anyway. I'm having surgery soon so even in the best case scenario I can't do shit till I recover.

Anyone else had their painkillers cut off cold turkey? Had my only source of relief pulled right out of my hands... Just awful

edit: I cried about it on the phone this morning and I ended up getting one final refill. It'll last till my surgery. She will eventually give me a referral to a pain mgmt dr and hopefully from there I won't be in excruciating pain.",
772,My pharmacy shorted my pills by 90%,"I am on Ultram for my Ehlers Danlos Syndrome pain. My pharmacy was already late on filling my pain meds this month, but I was able to ration them enough to get by. Today, I went to pick it up, and instead of the 90 pills I get? They gave me 9. They assured me they'd honor the rest of the pills ""sometime later this week,"" but I'm really worried about this :( I now it's nowhere near what some of y'all go through, but this really blindsided me and is stressing me out at the worst possible time. I'm about to go back to work full time, and I literally can't work without my medication.

The issue is, I can't find any other pharmacy that will fill the particularly high mg of Ultram I get around here, so I'm stuck!

EDIT: Thankfully, they filled the rest today!","EDS, Fibro, MCAS, and POTS"
773,My brother just informed me I'm carrying a suitcase half my weight up a flight of stairs tomorrow,"Update: I managed to get it into my apartment all by myself!!!
I front loaded my pain medication, took those stairs one at a time, and made a lot of noise dragging it up each step, but I did it!

Honestly, it was harder getting it into the car because I had to hoist it up higher.

I'm resting now, but I have plans to do some gentle socializing tonight and I think I'll feel well enough to do it. I'm feeling pretty good about myself right now.

Thank you everyone for your support. This sub has the kindest people in it, I'm so sorry you all hurt like I do.

Original post: Okay, quick background. 26 year old female, diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, fibro, and ankylosing spondylitis. I'm on no DMARDs because I currently have no medical insurance (whole separate issue I'm dealing with) and all I have to manage pain is gabapentin. Y'all know how effective gabapentin is when pain levels get high.

So tomorrow I told my brother I would pick my brother's suitcase up at the airport when I drop my husband off. They're going on a big trip, my brother needed to get his bag home, I'm gonna be there anyway, seemed like it made sense. 

So today I receive a message from him informing me that the suitcase is 48 pounds (just shy of the weight limit and literally half my weight) and it contains 900 dollars worth of bullshit that cannot be out in the heat, so it *needs* to be carried upstairs into my apartment immediately. 

My husband will not be in the state to help. 

So. How am I supposed to do this? It's gonna be 115 degrees tomorrow, heat exacerbates my symptoms, and today was my first good pain day in months. Is there a way I can do this without ruining my body for a week? I've got shit to do this week, I can't be laid up in bed for days, and my husband, as I've said, won't be around to help me with basic things like providing water.

I dunno. I guess I'm just looking for a little commiseration, and maybe a little courage to ask one of my male friends for help. But I hate playing the damsel in distress card almost as much as I hate pulling the disabled card, and I don't do well with asking for help when needed. 

Anyway, thank you for reading if you did. I hope everyone is feeling as well as possible today.","rheumatoid arthritis, gastroparesis, POTS"
774,Pain feels like a roller coaster,"I've had lots of inflammatory injuries (tendonitis/bursitis),and an achilles injury. In fact, here are the injuries I've had over the last 3 years:
Achilles
Trigger finger
Shoulder bursitis (too much basketball)
Hip bursitis 
Inner knees
Swimmers elbow

I've been to physical therapy,iced,used a tens unit,etc.

One part of the recovery is how injuries seem to go away for days/weeks,then come back even worse. It feels so random,too. I could walk a bunch and feel no pain. The next day I could get moderate rest and exercise and it feels like I ran a marathon.

I've always heard ""it has to get worse before it gets better"". I'd say I definitely experience this. So,in the times of this roller coaster of pain I get a false hope as it'll be really bad,then fine,but then it gets bad again.

Sorry for the lengthy ramble,but I'm just frustrated with my current injury of hips/knees as I've been doing EVERYTHING I can and it just keeps doing the roller coaster effect.",
775,Not Sure About My Diagnosis [X-Post from r/IBS],"I am a 14-year-old girl in the UK (my healthcare is free on the NHS) and after 4 years of chronic abdominal pain, I've been diagnosed with IBS. I do fit symptoms of it, such as:

* Pain/Cramping
* Diarrhoea/Constipation
* Bloating
* Nausea

However, some of my symptoms don't fit that much. Every IBS medication that I have tried, over the counter or prescribed, has done nothing/very little to stop the pain. I have a week before my period where the pain is at its worst, every single time, then my period, which is heavy and I get bad cramps too. I'm on birth control to stop the period and the pre-pain; I've had an ultrasound of my uterus/ovaries but nothing was 'wrong'. My pain is also constant: I do not have 'flare-ups' or breaks from it, I just have pain 24/7. It gets worse on some days but doesn't ever seem to get significantly better.

I was diagnosed with IBS by exclusion - they haven't found anything 'wrong' so it's IBS - and I've followed all the advice the dietitian gave me, yet I still have the pain and unusual bowel movements. It hurts no matter what I eat. There are only two things I can identify as making the pain worse, perhaps a couple of hours after eating them: slushies and ice lollies, which are relatively chemical-y and not exactly the hardest thing to exclude from my diet.

I've been tested for Celiac. I've kept a food diary. I've taken medicine (I'm currently on amitriptyline). And none of my symptoms ever get better, and I never get a break. The only examinations I've had were those where the doctors would put one hand on my abdomen and 'tap' with their other, and one ultrasound which took nearly three years to get. I don't know if I just have very bad IBS, but lots of the time I'm wondering if it could be something else. My medical history doesn't show anything that could be related to it; I have slight hypermobility in my ankles due to being born prematurely, but even then I was fine aside from that. 

If you've taken the time to read this, thank you.",
