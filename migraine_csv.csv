I had hoped the wiki to be running by now, but as with anything making it great takes time. In the mean time I wanted to sticky a post to highlight some of resources we have in place already.

----

### [Reddit's built in search!](https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/search?&amp;restrict_sr=on)

We get a lot of common questions, for which an FAQ on the wiki is being built to help with. For now though reddit's built in search is a great way to find common questions about almost anything. Just enter a medication, treatment, or really anything and it's likely to have a few dozen results. Don't be afraid to post or ask in our chat server (info below) if you can't find an answer with search, though you should familiarise yourself with the [rules](/r/migraine/about/rules) before hand.

&amp;nbsp;

###[Live chat!](https://discord.gg/eN7nYHv)

^(An account with a verified email is required to chat. If you worry about spam and use gmail, using a) ^[+modifier](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html) ^(is a good idea! There's no need to use the same username either.)

The chat server was started a few months back with the goal of filling the gap between the subs somewhat erratic pace, and to help people connect more easily. There's over 30 users in chat now, so come by and introduce yourself! If you run into issues, feel free to send us a modmail or ping @mods on discord. The same [rules](/r/migraine/about/rules) here apply in the chat server.

&amp;nbsp;

### [Migraine/pain log template!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iCSTyieFr3r1jyfMglvGydMcHE2VBEmP1fYYo9pCagc)

Exactly what it sounds like! A google docs spreadsheet for recording your attacks, treatments tried, and more. To use it without a Google account you can simply print a copy. Using it with a Google account means the graphs will auto-update as you use the log; just make a copy to your own drive by selecting File -&gt; Make a copy while signed in to your Google account.

&amp;nbsp;

### [Common treatments list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtDapeow5VP6dEo1UzdSWEtMM1pNSFdLUEc3c2JmZmc&amp;usp=sharing)

Yet another spreadsheet! This one is a list of common preventatives (prophylactics), abortives (triptans/ergots), natural remedies, and procedures. It's a good way to track what treatments you and your doctor have tried. Plus, it's formatted to be easily printable in landscape or portrait to bring to appointments (checklist &amp; long list respectively). Like above, the best way to use it is to make a copy to your Google drive with File -&gt; Make a copy.

This sheet is also built by the community. The sheet called Working Sheet is where you can add anything you see missing, and then it will be neatly implemented into the two main sheets periodically. A huge thanks from all of us to everyone who has contributed!

&amp;nbsp;

### Crisis support.

Past the live chat we don't have subreddit specific crisis support, for now at least. There are a lot of resources on and off reddit though.

One of the biggest resource on reddit is the **[crisis hotlines list](/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines)**. It's maintained by the /r/suicidewatch community and has a world wide list of crisis lines. Virtually all of which are open 24/7 and completely anonymous. They also have an [FAQ](/r/SWResources/comments/1c7ntr/suicide_hotline_faqs/) which discusses what using one of the hotlines is like.

For medical related help most insurance companies offer a nurse help line. These are great for questions about medication interactions or to determine the best course of action if nothing is helping. **If your symptoms or pain is different than normal, they will always suggest immediate medical attention such as an ER trip.**

1,Aimovig (CGRP) month 2 megathread.,"We can only have two sticky threads at a time, so [here's the first megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/8l78oa/cgrp_aimovig_megathread/) which has a bunch of great information on the process of being prescribed and getting the medication.

Like the first thread this is set to suggested sort of new. Feel free to share even if you're just starting, and update along the way. The first thread was so focused on the logistics of access to the medication, so hopefully this can be mainly experiences and results.

3,im letting my feelings out,"apologies for formatting, im on mobile 
im also sorry because i didnt really organize my thoughts and i feel like its obvious. im in the middle of a migraine and just need to talk about stuff that frustrates me

im on amitriptyline because it was the only medication that was available for me. the other two would result in weight loss and i cant really have that since im underweight as is and have a bit of a problem with eating.

i took it for a couple of months (at least more than 6, i cant remember exact time tho) and i stopped taking it on my own because im pretty sure that it didnt even work for my headaches. i wouldnt get headaches every day like i used to but im pretty sure that was because there was reduced stress in my life.

i know shouldnt just stop taking medication without discussing my doctor but i dont want to tell her that it doesnt really work for me. i had a hard enough time telling her that the pills she gave me to relieve headaches in 2 or so hours dont work at all. i felt bad for even getting a higher dosage because she and my parents dont think its right for a minor to be on medication for long periods of time. worst part is the higher dosage didnt even work either.

she scolded me for taking naps when she told me not to (but not taking naps gives me headaches) and wouldnt listen to anything i had to say about it because im not a toddler and shouldnt be taking naps when i get home. idk man im just tired. i dont want to see this doctor anymore because it feels like every time i go there i get the same speech about sleep and drinking water.

im considering getting a daith piercing and just stop going to the doctor. ive already missed my appointment with her twice because of bad scheduling. i just dont wanna go there again and i know its childish but i just dont want to face it. i dont wanna go there and be given a different medication that probably wont work, i dont want a higher dosage of something that genuinely doesnt work for me, and i dont want to listen to another speech about sleep and drinking water. im just tired

i dont want to look for another neurologist tbh. im giving up hope on doctors because all of the ones ive been to have been shit (very very general, its not just the neurologist). it took me months to get my parents to listen to me about my migraines and even longer to find a neurologist that would take a minor. i dont want to do it all again and waste money when it probably wont work.

the only medicine that helps me is excedrin right now which is great bc it is not expensive but it also sucks because i have a sensitivity to caffeine and can only take one pill without it affecting how i feel and function too much. i try not to take too much of it because i dont want medicine induced headaches but damn its hard to not take one everyday as a ""just in case""

sorry yall i just wanted to get this out and i didnt know where else to put it. i hope you have a great day or night. thanks for reading ",,1,1
4,Sporadic Hemiplegic Migraine,"Just found this sub, thought I'd see if anyone had experience dealing with SHM. For those that don't know what it is, it's often a painless form of migraine (ikr) that causes loss of movement on my right side in my leg mostly, sometimes my arm, and sometimes complete numbness on that side. 

I get the migraines as a result of being unable to deal with stressful situations due to Adrenal Suppression (don't make enough adrenaline, cortisol, sugar), and of course, it's a vicious circle as they stress out. I've been prescribed Naproxen which did absolutely nothing, Beta Blockers which made them worse as it somehow messed with how my Adrenal Suppression meds worked. 

My Neurologist, Endocrinologist and Respiratory Consultant are all in agreement that I can't be on stronger painkillers since I'm 21, they don't want me becoming dependent, and I'm inclined to agree with that. 

They don't happen very often now, but when they do there's nothing I can do about it. I'm put off learning to drive because of the migraines (and adrenal lows, sugar lows too), and my diagnosis of SHM is a sort of ""we'll go with this because it fits better, but we're still unsure"". 

Just thought I'd share my experiences with it and see if anyone else has any advice!",,1,1

7,Neck popping-new migraine symptom?,"I’ve had migraines for over 20 years now. Just felt grinding and hearing popping in my neck. Every time I turn my head to the left it pops. It’s an unpleasant feeling but doesn’t hurt too much. A dull pain and feels like it sends an electric feeling to the front of my head (eyebrow area).

9,"Any observant, orthodox Jews here? I'm in need of (niche) advice.","My apologies in advance to those reading who won't understand quite what I'm talking about.

I'm an observant orthodox jew, and a migraine sufferer. My migraines are usually not as bad as much of the things described here, but when I fast they get much worse than usual. Mainly, I assume, because of dehydration and caffeine withdrawal.
The last two fasts, 17 of Tammuz and 9 of Av where horrible. Insane headaches, nausea, and a postdrome lasting three days.
Since Yom Kippur is coming soon (with the fast of Gedalya as a kind of warm up), I was wondering if anyone here has been in the same predicament and has been given Rabinnic permission for some sort of easing, or has some advice on how to survive the fasts more easily (for advice that's not religion specific I'm also happy to hear from Muslims about what they do during Ramadan, or any other people who fast for any reason).

10,Namenda for migraines,"I  have been taking Namenda as a preventative medicine for my migraines. I have been on many different meds and they either didn't work or made me so dizzy or tired i couldn't function. Since I have been on namenda i finally don't have side effects. I still get occasional headaches, but I can deal with it. I had to go without it for about two weeks due to my prescription running out and doctor being frustrating about a new script. I had a constant migraine the entire time i was off of it. I am back on it now and felling better again.

12,Trokendi,"Hey guys!

I just wanted to share my experience because I’m having an awful time and I’m hoping maybe someone can help. I started getting migraines last year. I thought I was having a stroke. Started with an aura, lead to numbness in my face and hands, and ended with an unbelievable headache. To make a long story short, they concluded it was migraines. This year I was prescribed fioricet, which I adore. Whenever I start getting an aura, I take it and my symptoms stop within 20 minutes and I never get the full-blown migraine. 

I was having these episodes more frequently though so my doc prescribed me trokendi. Like most people, I started with a low strength and have ramped up to 100 mg. I usually have a migraine once a month or so, and tonight I had my third migraine this week. I’m not saying the medication is to blame, but I can’t explain the sudden spike. It’s been so anxiety-inducing because I never know when it could happen or why. Has anyone had this experience on trokendi? I’m so miserable. I’m going to call my doctor, I thought I’d ask here first. Maybe a different prescription could help? Any advice is welcome!",,1,1
13,DAE experience bile on the stomach?,"It doesn’t occur during every migraine, but some of my worst/most head pounding migraines will only be relieved by throwing up bile sitting in my stomach.

I bought some Vitamin B2 and took 400 mg for 3 days. After those 3 days, my Migraines completely disappeared! I can’t believe all that I had gone thru with these migraines from blurry vision to lightheadedness. If anyone is suffering I highly recommend giving it a try. It could have saved me thousands of dollars in medical costs that included MRIs. I’m now just taking 200 mg for maintenance and I’ve had no flare ups since I’ve started taking this supplement.",,1,1

23,My first migraine season without attack. Sharing what I learned.,"Classic migraine can make your life a living hell. I used to have 20-30 attacks a year. My first one was the worst, 2 days long, hurling every 30 minutes. 8 years later, I'm down to no attack, no prodrome and no brain-fog at all. Those are tips from my experience, YMMV.


1. Get to a doctor. Be sure there's nothing worse going on. Especially if you notice weight loss, night sweats, fever. 

2. If you get that brain-fog, take a Vitamin B-Combo. They're usually somewhere at a 1000%-1500% RDA dosage, which is just fine for that purpose. Also makes your pee go really really yellow. 

3. Have a coffee with your Vitamin B. I prefer green tea. Take a cold shower, dress light. Vasoconstriction is your friend! Some say Hibiscus tea, it too tampers with your blood pressure, haven't tried it yet though. 

4. Have sex, some say. Or rather, don't. Sex is awesome in your prodrome-phase, I guess it's the serotonine and your flushing arteries. But having an orgasm always makes the attack a sure thing for me, and makes the attack worse. This might be different for women!

5. Take an Ibuprofen. Halves the duration of an attack for me. Helps with the headache, too.

6. If you know it's really coming (when I see the aura, in my case), have a Triptan. Completely cancels an attack for me. This stuff is priceless. They say you shouldn't use more than 10 a month, to avoid rebound migraines.  

7. If you have your attack and will vomit, drink some baking soda dissolved in water before every time hurling. It will neutralize the stomach acid, and you'll actually have someting to throw up, which is nice. 

Long term: 

1. Identify triggers, avoid them. Especially food intolerances, lack of sleep, alcohol. 

2. Try acupuncture and TCM-herbs from a practitioner that was recommended to you. The herbs taken on brain-foggy days reduced my attacks from 30 down to 3 a year.

3. Try Osteopathy (maybe Chiro, but only one or two sessions.) Osteopath should work on the mobility of the front of your thorax, throat, sternum, oesophagus, lower ribs, diaphragm, liver and stomach, with mobilizations and lots of fascial techniques. Maybe get some cranio-sacral therapy, again ask around for a recommended practitioner. I know some people frown on this, but risk, expense vs. potential benefit are good IMO.

4. Get a sunbox for winter / seasonal depression to avoid the rebound in spring. Serotonine plays a role, and I had my migraines always in spring when the sun came back. I've got the Philips BluLight. Other options: http://www.sad.org.uk/recommended-manufacturers/ 

5. Sleep enough. Duh. Drink 100% RDA of magnesium citrate powder in hot water at night if you have a hard time sleeping. Try melatonin (start with only 0.3mg which is a  natural dose). Get a mattress and pillow you love, no exceptions. use a sleeping mask.

24,Someones hygiene managed to fuck up my whole progress.,"So since I've been finally diagnosed with migraines I made a LOT of progress. I've been through ups and downs, especially when I had the bright idea to stop my BC, but now things are really good! I'm on butterbur, a ton of magnesia and have two daith piercings.

But. After weeks of not having a migraine when I went shopping yesterday after training school there were not one, not two, but three people in the store who just shared the worst smell I have legit smelled in years. And I live in a big city! I don't know the story behind stuff like this, so I try not to judge, but the smell of not having showered for weeks mixed with the smell of cold, stale cigarette smoke and it was just so bad.

And they had swarmed out in a manner where there was nearly no part of the store that didn't smell, though it wasn't a small one! It was the worst at the register, because there was no way to get at least a bit away from one of the smellers. Some poor dude next to me gagged several times and eventually ran our, leaving his angry GF behind.

I couldn't get rid of the smell. I brushed my hair and used scented dry shampoo, I showered, changed my clothes. It doesn't linger on me, but I feel like it's stuck in my nose. And every once in a while I suddenly smell it again. Since then I'm having migraines again and after finally fighting off yesterdays one I already got the next one shortly after waking up.

I feel sorry for those smelly guys, but I'm also kinda upset. Things were going so well and now my weekend is ruined :(",,1,1

My dr suggested tylenol and I want to kill him. I need a new doctor but that takes time and I'm going crazy. Please send help.**

Background: I have had classic migraines with and without aura, plus tension type headaches for as long as I could remember. 

* My migraines began getting worse with the onset of puberty (am female), so I thought that by getting my periods under control, I could ""cure"" this problem. Was diagnosed with Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) which is like PMS on steroids. Finally got it under control with eliminating periods through Depot Lupron needles. Lessened headaches but didn't eliminate them.

* Allergies were also a trigger so I ended up avoiding hay, ragweed, dust and mold and also took allergy meds. Lessened migraines but didn't eliminate them.

* Treated my depression with anti-depressants, and ADHD with stimulants. Lessened migraines but didn't eliminate them.

When the above didn't eliminate these migraines, I finally went to my doctor for help. He looked at my medical history and finally said, ""have you tried TYLENOL?""

Fuck yes, I have. It doesn't help really. I also have tried taking muscle relaxants, aspirin, ibeprophen, naproxen and when I'm really desperate mixing multiple pain killers. It only works half the time.

I've tried drinking more water, avoiding the sun like I'm some underground gremlin, hiding in the house when the weather changes, yoga, relaxation techniques like meditation and deep breathing, physiotherapy, trigger point relaxation and exercise, caffeine, sleep hygiene, self-care, etc.

What are my next steps? What can I do to help my incompetent doctor? Are there some medications I can ask him to look into? I am stuck with this asshole for a doctor thanks to doctor shortages and being in college. I'm from Canada if that helps.

Please help me.

This morning I woke up at 3:30a with an awful migraine. 9/10 pain, no vision in right eye, neck/shoulder pain, vomiting, aura, dizzy, confusion. The works. 


My husband knew this was a bad one without me even saying anything. He jumped in to action mode. He called my doctor as soon as they opened and got me the first morning appointment. He took off work to drive me. He sat in the office with me while I got my shots. He brought me home. Put me to bed. He brought me a drink. He turned on my favorite tv show at a low volume. Then left me to sleep. He checked in with me every hour or so, even tho he knew I’d be asleep most of the time. If my water was empty, he replaced it. I just got up for the day (4:00p) most symptoms are gone or much better. He offered me food, more to drink and asked if I needed anything.

I recently started tracking on the Migraine Buddy app and realized that every single one of my migraines were triggered (or at least partly triggered) by a two hour change in my sleep schedule - either sleeping two hours later than normal or going to bed two hours later. So since then I have kept a really strict and consistent sleep schedule and am going on 4 weeks migraine free. Just wanted to share in case this helps anyone else. ",,1,1

43,Sleepy on Triptans,"Hi all! I went to the neurologist a few weeks ago, and he prescribed me Rizatriptan as a rescue medication for my migraines.

I decided to wait until a weekend migraine to try them out because I’m never sure how different medications will affect me.  I’m currently struggling with a low dosage of an acne medication that has caused a copious amount of unpleasant side effects, so it has made me gun shy of new medicines.

While the pain went away, I had some side effects that will prevent me from taking them at work (and since my migraines typically hit early afternoon that doesn’t work for me).

Has anyone experienced being really sleepy/groggy from triptans? The first one I took I stayed awake but was having a really hard time talking.  The second one I took I had a searing pain in my neck and then fell asleep for two hours.

On the plus side it did make the head pain go away.

44,Migraines after hot yoga,"I’ve searched this topic in this forum but I’m looking for more information than I could find.  I signed up for a 10 pack session to Bikram style hot yoga. The classes are 90 min each.  I feel great during and after class but for my last two classes, a migraine hits just about exactly two hours after the class ends.  

I tried to prepare by adding an electrolyte supplement to my water, and drinking plenty of water before during and after class (3-4 liters/day). I also take mag oxide and CoQ-10 every night and a multivitamin each morning. For my migraines (and anxiety) I’m also taking Effexor. I also use a mouth splint for TMD. 

I also do orange theory fitness workouts 4-5x a week and I don’t have this same issue.  In fact, if I feel like crap before class, I usually feel better afterwards. So it’s not that I’m not used to working out. 

Has anyone else had improvement in the headaches? Are there specific electrolytes I should try to add more of? The hot yoga feels so good especially when working out so hard the other days, I just want to hear there may be hope that I can continue yoga without migraines! ",,1,1
45,Migraines and the mini pill question,"Hi guys, 

I used to take the combination pill years ago until my doctor took me off it because he found out I had visual migraines. So I was then not on any birth control for a couple years and I maybe had 1 or 2 migraines in total over that period. 

Now I have been on birth control since late last year (I tried the bar first but it made me crazy, now I am on the mini pill) and I have had 5 during that time. Two of those have been in the last two days.

Is it possible that the bar/mini pill has caused an increase in visual migraines? I thought that sent they don't have estrogen they would help prevent visual migraines?

Anyone have any thoughts on this? Maybe it's a coincidence?

Edit: Thanks for the responses, guys. It looks like it might be a coincidence since your migraines seemed to improve with the mini pill. I am going to ask my doctor what she thinks at my next appointment (on Monday). Thanks again! And of course if anyone else has thoughts on this please leave a comment. :)",,1,1

47,finding neurologist in UK,"Hello everyone! I'm moving to England later this month (London to be specific) and I've just started exploring how to get a neurologist for emergencies while I'm there. From what I think i understand, I need to have a referral from a GP before I can go in to see a neurologist ... however, there's a waitlist for all the GPs in my catchment area and then there's another 12-15 week waitlist to get into see the neurologist. 

I'm completely unfamiliar with the English healthcare system, and was wondering if it's possible to use a referral from a GP or a neurologist outside the UK to get onto the English neurologist's waiting list. I'm increasingly worried that I will need a neurologist in an emergency situation, and will have to go to the emergency department or an urgent treatment center.

48,Anyone have experience confronting noisy neighbors?,"I live in a first floor apartment and my upstairs neighbors make a considerable amount of noise at all hours, daytime and in the middle of the night. Not loud music or parties, but stomping and slamming sounds. Recently we've decided they must have, like, gym equipment up there. The sheer amount of noise created by the stomping sound is so loud that I don't think I could make that noise with my feet if I tried. I feel like it has to be coming from a bowflex or similar machine.

Last night, while I was in the worst migraine I've ever had that I remember, and extremely sensitive to sound, they were making these noises and I could swear I heard the spring type sounds from a small trampoline. Today I'm in a migraine hangover and I'm still very light and sound sensitive, doing almost nothing but sitting in a dark, quiet room. Just a few minutes ago, they did something upstairs that jolted me up from the noise. I regularly feel that they might fall through my ceiling at any moment, that's how loud the noise is. For comparison, I have heard them run the vacuum up there, which is very quiet compared to the stomping, and I wasn't able to hear the footsteps over the vacuum, so I know the noises that bother me are not from typical household activities.

I often think about going up there to talk to them, especially since their activities make my migraines worse. I have complained about them to the apartment manager several times, and they don't care. I just don't get how people can be so inconsiderate. I've lived on the second floor of an apartment before, and I was always very careful to make sure we weren't stomping or otherwise disturbing anyone. I never would have considered doing anything that makes as much noise as they make, which I have to think is louder in their apartment than it is in mine, simply because of proximity... Ugh...

I have the opportunity to start doing Botox. My migraines have recently become 5-6 days a week, making me miss 1 day of work per week, as well as productivity on the days i'm actually in. I'll also be starting my twice a week night classes soon on top of work.

I applied for botox two weeks ago after a dreadful 14 day migraine that landed me in the ER twice and made me lose 4kgs from the nausea. I was so terrified from that happening again so I decided I should bite the bullet and start botox.

Oddly enough I haven't had a migraine in 3 days. My botox appointment is in two weeks. Im now grappling with whether I should see if they will improve, or do the Botox knowing that the migraines will probably be worse once Im doing work full time +school.

Im mostly worried about potential side effects like drooping eyelids, or that my migraines might decide to decrease pre-botox. Its so hard to predict. :(

74,"Daily migraines or just ""headaches?""","Hello, I was hoping for some input from you guys about my diagnosis. Maybe I'll just tell you my story. I would love some input/thoughts/opinions. 

TLDR - I'm wondering if my headaches really are migraines or some other type of headache. My Dr thinks they're migraines.

Anyway... My Mom got migraines, not too often, but she got a pretty typical migraine where she had to hide out in a dark room and sometimes vomited. I've only had maybe 2 or 3 migraines like that (but no nausea or vomiting). About 12 years ago I started getting spells of vertigo. Very strong and would usually last 2-3 days. I got them anywhere from 2-5 times per year. I don't get motion sick at all (luckily!) so I just experience the spinning sensation. I don't really mind it all that much except it interferes with my ability to do things. I also get ""icepick"" headaches occasionally.

Fast forward... This past December ('17) I noticed that I had had a lot of headaches. I got more frequent spells of vertigo and by mid-December I've been having a headache all day every day. I also have very mild vertigo every day. I'm slightly sensitive to light and sound (certain frequencies are worse than others). Movement is the worst. 

I found it hard to drive the other day because turning my head to check my blind spot made it hurt a lot. In general the headaches aren't horrible, but they're enough to be distracting. Like if I just had it for one day I probably wouldn't bother taking anything. But it's been every single day for almost 9 months! I'm starting to feel like I'm going to lose it! I'm not a coffee drinker (like 0 coffee) but one day I tried having 3 cups to see if it helped (it didn't). Alcohol does seem to help but it might be that I don't care about it as much...but can't rely on that as medicine lol! 

I've seen a specialist (an ENT) and had an MRI. The MRI is clear except for a small mucosal retention cyst in each of my maxillary sinuses. My Dr said that those definitely would not be causing my headaches.

My ENT said that they're visibular migraines. He prescribed my amitriptyline. I've been taking it for about a week or so... I can't quite remember the day I started. I posted previously about it not working and you guys gave me hope that if I hang in that it might start working. I'm still having the headaches but I'm still taking the meds so time will tell if they work.

I guess I don't feel like they're ""real"" migraines because they are not nearly as painful as a ""typical"" migraine. When I tell people they're a headache they suggest that maybe I'm tired or dehydrated, but if I say that they're a migraine people don't believe me since I'm not huddled in the dark. 

I guess I'm also skeptical myself any my doctor is kind of a dick and I'm wondering if he's right.",,1,1

81,Sinus migraines?,"I just got back from a trip in Paris on Friday night. On the flight back I was feeling a little chilly, kind of like the feeling of an impending cold. Lo-and-behold the very next day, I am sick as a dog. Just constantly coughing, chest congestion, mucus, mouth-breathing, and fever. 


I rest for the whole day on Saturday, wake up on Sunday with most of the fever and chills gone but leaving me with chest congestion, clear mucus, small coughs, and clogged nostrils. I was beginning to think it was a common cold that was not going to last long. Took some Ibuprofen and let it be. 


Wake up on Monday and I'm feeling the same. For some weird reason, I can't get a good night's sleep. Slept for 6 hours, still feeling a bit groggy in the morning, blamed it mostly on jetlag. I'm totally fine on Monday (Labor Day) until around in the late afternoon. I ate dinner around 7PM, cozied off into bed to watch some Netflix. After an hour or two laying down, I get up to use the restroom to find myself get a rush of fatigue and lightheadedness. It was a feeling where you feel buzzed from alcohol and where you're sleep-deprived but mixed at the same time. I was taken aback because it was definitely a new sensation. I did not feel vertigo, did not feel nauseous, and I was able to walk straight with good balance. If my memory serves me correct, I did feel a slight sensitivity to light. I started feeling very minor tingling sensations on the tip of my left fingers and my lower left face. These were red flags to me and I started question the severity of my situation. However, I was still able to talk fine, vision was fine, comprehend things fine, no drooping or weakness on face/limbs, and the tingling sensations went away. Then immediately after, I started to develop a dull, throbbing, and moderate headache on the left side of my head. The headache was unlike most and it was at a pinpoint location. If you line your fingers to the tragus of your ears, and then go up along the side of your head until it reaches your crown and your head starts to curve/flatten; that's where the radiating throbbing headache was focused in. My first initial reaction is that it was a migraine, and I don't really ever get migraines. I also thought that migraines were only located on the temples. It was at this moment where I started to panic a bit more, ""was I experiencing a migraine attack? anxiety attack? stroke?"". I would lay down in bed and feel the headache become more throbbing, which scared me even more. I calmed down a bit because I was thoroughly convincing myself that this was more related to anxiety/migraine because the headache and symptoms developed gradually with minimal symptoms, and that it was a left sided headache with left sided face/finger tingling (left brain stroke would affect my right). I fell asleep, woke up 2 hours in the night before waking up abruptly to see if my face was drooping (it wasn't), and then fell back asleep for 5 more hours. 


Woke up today (Tuesday) feeling a bit better. Found myself a bit more feverish than yesterday and woke up with some night sweats. After waking up, feeling more relaxed, I start feeling more pressure on my face -- more specifically my sinuses. I felt a mini left jaw muscle spasm, subtle tightness on my left neck, left ear pop, and some pressure behind my left cheekbones. That's when it dawned me -- ""Do I have a sinus infection?"". The triggers from my trigeminal nerves starts making me believe that this is some sort of sinus/migraine. I start pressing on my sinuses and start feeling the mucus in the back of my throat push out. I've never had a sinus infection and my mucus is still clear so I am currently unsure of my situation. Currently, I'm beginning to feel more groggy/tiredness as I've been up for 5 hours now, with only semi-okay sleep. I still feel the throbbing sensation headache/migraine on the same left sided spot on my head but it comes and goes and is not as persistent as last night. I still feel sinus pressure and I do notice a loss of appetite. I just booked an appointment with a primary care physician two days from now and was wondering if anyone ever experienced anything similar and would give me some tips with my situation? Best xx

82,Aimovig in Canada... saw the doctor today,"Apologies if this should be in the sticky Aimovig thread. It was more of a story about trying to get it here in Canada where it was recently approved. 

Doc said it won't be publicly available until around the new year -- but that I could get a prescription for it if I wanted it. Problem would be paying. Those types of drugs are notoriously expensive, he said. 

Anyone been able to get any here in Canada so far? The approval was relatively new - so I'm not sure what I was expecting. 

Meantime got more relpax and a script for Toradol... not the IV/Injectable kind either. So not sure how well that'll work....

Just an FYI for fellow Canadian migraine sufferers. ",,1,1

Also, a terrible stoner. Pot hits my nervous system in real bad ways.

But on a whim, I sampled a strain sold here in LA called ""3C ACDC"" which is low on THC and high in CHDs, and what? It was real mild. Barley gave me a high. Felt relaxed though.

During a nasty onset of a migraine, I had to pass on triptan as I just took 2 the night before to unsuccessfully kill a headache. I instead gave the weed a try and holy moly. It knocked my pain level from a 6 to a 1 and I felt totally calm. I downed some electrolytes before bed and I woke up headache free.

Gonna buy an ounce from our local dispensary and give it some work.

88,"Chronic, daily, mostly low level migraine?","Hi all. I recently had my diagnoses changed by my new headache specialist/neurologist and wanted to see if anyone has experienced anything similar.

tl;dr: anyone else have daily migraine at a low-ish pain level for the most part?

I've had daily headache my entire life, which I always described as ""tension headache."" Over the last year, I began to get what were diagnosed as migraines. Once a month turned into once a week which turned into almost daily. A neurologist diagnosed me with both chronic migraine and occipital neuralgia, and said the ON was causing both the tension and migraine pain. 

I recently transferred care to a head pain center that I respect and trust. My new neurologist there strongly believes that my daily headache is not a tension headache, but a chronic and daily state of migraine.

Like I said, I trust this doctor wholeheartedly. I'm just don't know how to wrap my head around this. I always understood migraine as the ""knock you to your knees, whimpering and holding back vomit as you weakly rip open your abortives"" type of pain, which I'm only having a few times a week (thanks to my daily meds). However, my daily headache, which I previously identified as a tension headache, definitely includes light/sound sensitivity.

EDIT to add that he disagrees with the ON diagnosis based on my symptoms and lack of response to gabapentin.

92,Migraines triggered by weather and sinus abnormalities -- similar experiences?,"First time poster here. I have suffered from migraines (no aura) for almost 30 years, usually 1-2 times a month, often multiple days. I notice a strong relation between an abrupt change in weather (from dry/calm to humid/windy) and the onset of a migraine. I have always suspected that there is something abnormal about my sinus cavities and my ability to adapt to the pressure change, but of course I don't have hard data to back this up. In my previous attempts to get treatment (have seen several neurologists over the years) my sense has been there is a resistance to acknowledging the possibility that sinus issues could cause a migraine. Rather, they argue, the migraine causes sinus symptoms. To be clear, I don't have sinus drainage issues or sinusitis. I just notice the link with weather patterns and also sometimes when the headache finally subsides I can actually feel and hear air releasing/equalizing in my maxillary sinuses. So my question for this community is, have any of you ever received confirmation that sinus abnormalities might be a cause of your migraine? Any suggestions for how I should proceed? If you have a similar pattern as me, any particular treatments that tend to work? (I have used many rx migraine meds and actually found that sinus meds worked best but the side effects exclude them as an option.) Thanks!",,1,1

Anyone have any advice on approaching starting a family with migraines?

I have a host of rescue meds that I’ve been trying to back off on using due to overuse issues. 

I am hoping to be able to try to conceive in about a year. However, I am aware that I can’t jump into this as easily as the average woman on the street. Did you have anyone on your team besides your neurologist? Did you see an OB before actually conceiving? I’m assuming I’ll have to taper off my current meds, or switch to other, less teratogenic, ones, and that makes me very nervous because I haven’t been able to drop below my current dosages in years without my headaches getting out of control. 

Thanks for any input anyone might have! ",,1,1
96,Inconsistent Migraines,"I'm pretty new to the world of migraines, I started having them at the beginning of August. I've heard that migraines typically have the same symptoms in each time, but mine seem to be quite inconsistent. Of the five that I've hard, only two were fairly similar. 

Those two involved light and sound sensitivity and slight lightheadedness. One was just sound sensitivity, another cased me to have trouble walking in a straight line, dizziness, and severe brain fog. Each one of those were rather debilitating, though the headache itself was pretty mild, was just head pressure rather than pain. (silent migraines) 

The first one was the only one to have severe head pain, definitely was the worst headache I've ever had. That one had severe brain fog, blurred vision, and dizziness. 

I do realize its a pretty small sample size, but has any one else experienced extremely varied migraines?

97,I need help for my constant headaches.,"Iv been struggling with constant headaches for the last 5 months. Ive been seeing a neurologist, gotten mri’s, took triptans, and now on a ssri. My headache is still here! Taking rizatriptan has given me some relief but it never has made it completely go away. When I started taking an ssri I had a week of relief and felt amazing but I feel like Im now back where I started. 

My headaches started when I had a really bad anxiety attack. Long story short, I was panicking that I had brain eating bacteria because I used tap water to clean my neti pot. I freaked out and went to a care now type place and told me I was having an anxiety attack. After a few weeks past by I realized that everything was alright but Im now left with this constant headache.

My headache is always located on the very top of my head on my scalp region (I feel like this is a odd place to have headaches). It is a constant dull headache that is more annoying than painful. The pain is a 4 out of 10. Taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen usually does not help reduce the pressure on top of my head. 

I have had this type of headache before from an anxiety attack a few years ago but it went away within a week or 2. 

I am wondering if there is anyone else out there that also experiences these dull “tensions like” headaches on the scalp region of their head. I am still in the search of relieve. I hope I start to get relieve because this constant pain is really starting to take away my life. I no longer enjoy anything due to the constant pains I feel.

I believe my next step is going to start seeing psychiatrist because I think its most likely all related to anxiety. I no longer feel anxious but still have this constant headache that wont go away.

I hope someone can relate what I am going through and can give me some advice.

Thank you!",,1,1
98,Do your migraines/auras vary a lot?,"I have only had them for about 6 months, and had about 6 since then, so I don't have a very big sample, but they vary a lot:

First was just nausea and then a mild headache with no aura, but numbness and everything looked green.

Second time had an aura with a dozen or so bright lights floating around when I sneezed, and then nausea but no headache.

Then two that had no aura, just nausea and mild headache. One time I had nausea and my eyes span when I stood up, for about 7 hours, my friend said it could have been a migraine. Although for every other migraine so far, after it is over I notice that pinpoint lights like stars start to fly around in random directions.

Then last week I was falling asleep and felt a rather intense mix of half a numb head, tingling lips, a strange smell, feeling my heartbeat in the middle of my head, and many small stars in vision as well as things moving around my room. And just before, I had a strange experience when I was remembering an event, that I cannot describe. Then nausea for the next day, and the next day more nausea but at about 1am a moderate headache quickly turned into a headache that was categorically worse than anything I've had before. Might be the most painful thing I've experienced, affecting my left temple and eye, and I could feel the vein in my temple spasming. That lasted about 40 minutes until I stood up, then disappeared almost immediately, but bending over seemed to make it start again. That was Friday and since then, I've felt ok, just waves of nausea sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I can correctly categorize the aura and migraine of the last one, but the timing of it all was weird. Just wondering if this is a common thing from your experiences and if they might settle down or something.

101,Really struggling with this migraine,"Last Tuesday (6 days ago) I got a migraine. Typically my migraines are mostly intense nausea, with the headache being mild. I always feel very ill up to a peak, and then it goes away within 12 hours.

6 months ago I had my first migraine in a couple years following exam stress. It was milder than my previous ones, however after the initial day I suffered milder symptoms for 8 days (postdrome maybe?).

Fast forward to this migraine. Happened 6 days ago, was very much like my last one. The next day I felt much better but still not well, waves of nausea and dizziness and feeling unwell with a mild headache. Symptoms slowly began to improve, until the day before yesterday where I stupidly ate a big cheeseburger with fries. Woke up at 6am the next morning feeling really nauseous, but was unable to vomit (I have never been able to vomit from a migraine). I sat in front of the toilet for a few hours and then finally the nausea began to go down. It felt like I had started everything all over, from day 1.

However, last night I had the worst night ever. I started to feel nauseous before bed, and it got significantly worse and worse. At this point I was constantly feeling the urge to be sick but I couldn't!:( I spent the entire night by the toilet, falling asleep for no more than 20 mins before being woken up by my nausea. This morning the nausea started to ease up but then resumed an hour later and ever since has stayed the same.

I don't know what to do??:( I've gone to a pharmacist and was very helpful and didn't seem worried about my symptoms. He gave me some good anti nausea medicine but it didn't seem to do much. I also haven't been eating much, and feel my stomach aching because of it and feel it may be contributing to my nausea? Also I have been slightly constipated haha.

How do I progress? Do I just rest and hope it goes away? Keep eating bland toast and small meals? Or do I try power through? Or do I seek further medical assistance? To make matters worse I'm on holiday in Cornwall with my gfs family, so any advice to help me would be greatly appreciated.",,1,1

I've noticed that since the collision, my (already present) migraines haven't got more frequent, but they have got much worse. Now the pain is even worse (which I honestly didn't think was possible), I vomit every time (which is new) which doesn't relieve the pain at all, and I get postdrome for at least the 2 days following. 

So, I was wondering whether you guys have any experience with whether swimming helps recover in postdrome? I have slept all my body will let me sleep, so that's not an option. I didn't know whether taking the weight off my body and doing some gentle exercise would help, or whether the pressure changes in the water or the noise etc would make it worse?

So, I have an undiagnosed ED, so I don’t wanna label it but it’s enough to say that I restrict and exercise to the point of being underweight and not getting my period. 

I have migraines a few times a month, maybe 2-5, it varies. Not as bad as some folks here for sure, I count myself lucky there. But goddamn, they get so bad during my period. I’m out of it for a few days before, and I get incredibly nauseous. It’s already my worst symptom, I would take the pain over the nausea any day, but it gets even worse on my period. 

So even though I know it’s bad for me, it’s just another reason to restrict. 
If I’m underweight I won’t be in a tripled amount of pain plus the usual discomfort. I won’t dread yet another part of my life. It really fucking sucks, and the only  “”good””part is that I can’t eat during a migraine so it gets me closer to my goal. It’s just a fucked up situation.

125,"I created my own ""spoon"" deficit, and I'm already paying for it, but I'd do it all over again.","Yesterday, I took my kid to the amusement park, which is probably not a big deal to most people. For migraineurs, it's a bit of a different proposition with the strong smells of carnival food, the heat that's amplified by so much pavement and machinery, the crowds of people, the loud noises, and the rides themselves that are nightmare hellscapes of jarring movements and flashing lights. No amount of gatorade, cool towels, and breaks was going to alleviate all the triggers. 

My almost-four-year-old has been asking all summer to go to our local amusement park, and we made a deal that if he goes three weeks without having any toilet-related accidents, then we would go. He kept up his end of the bargain, so I've had to leverage about a weeks' worth of spoons into making this happen for him. He had a blast, which is a victory. I realize that it's not easy to be a preschooler with a single mom who is out of commission a lot thanks to migraines, so it was an easy choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, we're snuggled up on the couch with ice packs, and I'll probably be in for a rough weekend, but I did it.

126,Has anyone ever gone off meds to try to relieve rebound headaches?,"I have come off all medications that contribute to rebounds. My main culprit was Excedrin Migraine (yes, I know it's bad but I had to graduate). Now I'm off everything, even meds you wouldn't think would contribute (like Zyrtec). I am allowed to take Naproxen and phenergan. I started the med withdrawal August 1st so I'm a whole month in which I'm grateful for. 

Has anyone else done this? What was your experience like? Were you allowed to take anything during it? (My paperwork from my neuro specifically says Naproxen doesn't contribute but if you google it it says it does. I'm probably just paranoid at this point). How long until the rebounds were gone?

127,Is it normal for migraines to change?,"Since 7th grade I've been getting some eye flashers that kinda fuzz and block out my vision. Usually happend about once a year.

First few times/years it was just the fuzz and that was it, then in the next few years I had really bad headaches after the vision fuzz. 

It's been probably like 4-5 years since I stopped having them, however I still sometimes get crippling headaches without the fuzz every few months.

128,Do I have Occipital Neuralgia?,"So, about 10 years ago I had a problem with one of my teeth. Got it treated, got a crown but it always felt uncomfortable. That's when the headaches started and never stopped. I'd get severe headaches behind my left eye, behind my ear, on my left temple, down my skull....basically the whole left side. It lasts for weeks and never goes away. Sometimes it is bearable and other times it's crippling. It makes my left eye water and my left ear makes sounds. No meds work at all and sleeping actually makes it worse. I do get normal headaches too but they're so different than this, never the same and never last for weeks. I realized that they're always the worst when I wake up and usually the pain moves to my neck, shoulder and arm. Everything feels sore. The left side of my face feels numb and my scalp hurts when I touch it, can't sleep on that side or brush my hair because it hurts so badly. I've been to countless doctors during the past 10 years, all kinds of specialists. Had my eye, ear checked. Had an MRI like 6 years ago and nothing was remarkable. Had xrays for my mouth and jaw. Had that tooth removed because it developed a chronic abscess and they told me once it's gone I'll lose the headache but it's been two years since I had the tooth and abscess removed and I still get terrible headaches.

OTC meds help a little but not completely (and anytime a headache comes on they usually knock it out). I don't have any nausea, auras, sensitivity to light or anything.

134,Little to No Response to Aimovig? Curious About Possible Causes,"This is just speculation and general wondering. I recently remembered that I have low immunoglobulin A (IgA) that was discovered during some routine blood work for IBS and allergies. It made me wonder about how low immunoglobulin would affect one's response to Aimovig. Aimovig is specifically an IgG2 antibody, so I'm wondering if some people have little to no response to it because they have low IgG2 antibodies. I don't know my IgG2 levels but have read that low IgA and low IgG2 are often found together. I had what may have been a good response to Aimovig in the first couple weeks but have since seen a resurgence of symptoms. I know it's still relatively early and am looking forward to my next dose of Aimovig, but my scientific curiosity is piqued since this is such a novel medication.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone here happen to know anything about their own immunoglobulin levels and are on Aimovig? Or know anything about how low IgG2 might affect one's response to Aimovig? I'm meeting with my neurologist next week for a follow up and will mention my questions to him, as well!

135,Proposal for more structured moderating of the r/migraine subreddit.,"Fellow migraineurs —

I find myself here in this sub often. More often than I’d like and always with a desperate need to answer a burning question. I find it quite difficult to sift through the posts and responses, which can leave me more frustrated than when I came to visit. You all are a MAJOR support system to me whether you know it or not and I would love for us all to be able to engage with and help each other more effectively.

Thus I’d like to propose that we instill more structure to the posting process in this sub. Obviously the mods would implement and drive this, but I think creating the following tags would be so super excellent.

[Treatment] - questions about and personal experiences with specific treatments, including topics around doctors visits, medication, and other holistic options

[Symptoms] - questions about and personal experiences with specific symptoms

[Support] - resources for emotional support, rants/vents about how damn hard it can be to suffer from migraine, and general topics about managing migraines in daily life

[Appreciation] - because this sub helps us all

Thoughts? Suggestions?

137,"Something sort of positive for once - I'm in pain, but at least my neurologist rocks.","The past few months have SUCKED hardcore. I'm lucky that my migraines aren't continuous like they are for some of y'all, but I've lost count of how many I have a month - at least 20, thankfully I get a day or two off here and there, but I'll have weeks where they're every 16-18 hours and I end up having to go in for IVs. I posted earlier this week asking about Tricare coverage of Aimovig since it's basically my last hope.

BUT, something positive to celebrate - my neurologist is basically my favorite person in the world right now. I probably harass her office on a weekly basis for steroids, needing an IV, to call in the Aimovig - and they are SO, so helpful. She's in her 70s I think and makes me promise to wear a scarf because my neck gets stiff, she's adorable. I love her. She's basically kept me alive the past few months.

138,Topiramate withdrawal?,"So my neurologist advised that I stop my medications because one (Namenda) wasn't working at the other (Trokendi XR/Topiramate) was causing too many side effects. I followed their instructions for stopping the medicine, but from what I've read they made me stop it way too fast.

I was taking 100mg Trokendi XR for 6-7 months, and 75mg of Topiramate (split AM/and PM) since September of last year. My neuro said to take my 100mg Trokendi every other day for a week, then I would be fine to stop it.

I've had the worse sleep lately, unable to stay asleep or feel rested. I've also just felt sick, nauseous, and just generally under the weather. I chalked it up to stress, but I'm wondering if I made myself sick by stopping my meds too fast.

Unfortunately, therapy sounds a little bull-shitty to me for something potentially caused by the same thing as my migraines.

140,It's back - continuous migraine after long interval without pain.,"Two summers ago I took a decongestant which resulted in a pang of anxiety and the veins on the left side of my head to audibly throb and gush. What followed was a continuous headache(tension with some migrainous features) for about 10 months. MRA was clean. After trying two drugs for 9 months, I started Effexor XR which I seemed to have been most responsive to. I started feeling relief within the 4-5th week of using it, and the thing just gradually but slowly went away that year. The neurologist thought it was something to the effect of cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, or a ""vasospam"" as he said. 
    
Fast forward to last week's Monday. I had the day off, indulging in some moderate day drinking, I ended up at my friend's place to check out some programming stuff. I had two energy drinks to sober up a little at his place, and a bit after that I started feeling a migraine forming on the left side of the head accompanied by left arm/hand numbness. On the next morning, Thinking it was the same as the last awful thing from two years ago I immediately went to the ER to be checked in a panic, I received IV treatment and a hydroxyzine script for the anxiety. And I've been feeling it ever since, it's more of a migraine than a tension manifestation, more unilateral than bi-, switches sides, odd arm feelings, etc. 
I met with my general practitioner for and additional check and a refill of effexor which I started on the third day of the headache, and I'm planning on going to a neuro clinic next month if it continues. 
    
While this does feel like the old headache to some extent, there are some differences, I'm really hoping that it will blow over.
    
I could really use some support, and accounts from people who have suffered through multiple long ones.

141,Starting to get ocular migraines... not fun,"So I never had migraines or even headaches as a kid. In college I would get mild headaches occasionally but nothing tylenol couldn't fix.
I'm 22 now and few months back I had a sudden zig zag in my vision ( a la harry potter) accompanied by some pain. Luckily I was on vacation so I immediately popped some pills and slept for 6 hours. 
A week ago I had bright circles in my vision late at night. I woke in the morning with a splitting headache behind my left eye, light sensitivity and nausea. I managed to make it to my grad school classes later that day but I felt like crap.

Should I plan for my third migraine to be worse?? I don't want to worry too much but I've only had two so far and they were both debilitating.

142,Questions about Occipital Nerve Block,"Hello fellow brain pain sufferers!

I've had a migraine for 15 months now and almost nothing has helped without insane side effects. I had an occipital nerve block yesterday, and felt spectacular for the ~20minutes that the numbing agent was active, then it wore off and I'm a mess again.

It was also excruciatingly painful and felt like an ice pick lobotomy 

I'm scheduled to have them done weekly for the next five weeks

So my question for anyone else who has had them:

How long do they normally last? How much does it hurt for you? Have you had the nerve burnout? Has this worked for you?

Thanks",,1,1

145,And I’m back — Anybody experience mood dips after severe migraine episode?,"I’ve posted a few times before regarding my chronic migraines, but it’s been awhile.  Much to my dismay, I’m back. I would like to briefly re-tell my story.  I’ve battled chronic migraine since I was 17, and almost two decades later my migraines have never stopped.  Last year, I was pregnant with my second child where my migraines became more severe and frequent.  I hit absolute bottom at this point and seriously wanted to do myself in because I just couldn’t take any more pain.  After the birth of my beautiful healthy baby girl, I exclusively breastfed.  During the last 6.5 months, I didn’t have any migraines.  My life did a complete 180 — I experienced life without the horror of chronic, debilitating migraines.  I even became cocky, like I had somehow forgotten what it was like to feel THIS pain.

On Thursday, my migraines returned.  Full force. I’ve had 4 in the past week and yesterday the pain was so bad I couldn’t take it any more.  I haven’t had an episode that bad in years.  Today, I am extremely depressed, in a fog, and still in pain.  After knowing what it was like to not have this pain, I just can’t bear the thought of going back to it.  The only thing I can attribute this change to is that I introduced solids to my little and my hormones are changing back.

I hope my writing makes sense.  I suppose I just need some support because I am at the verge of tears but know that crying will only make the pain worse.

She actually has a hard time getting the needles in my neck because those muscles are so tight. She says that’s never happened before, which sucks, but also validates I’m hopefully on the right path. 

I’ve done 8 sessions and probably have many more ahead. Im certainly not cured but feel really hopeful this will help.  She also gave me a bunch of stretches to do when I’m feeling tight (um...all the time!) is tyTs helpful.

Thought I was just psyching myself out and then I saw the blurry flashes.   I was close to home so I went straight there.  First thing I did this time was drink 2 beers as quick as I could.  I know this isn’t the standard course of action when a migraine comes on but apart from the slight headache, the visual aura seems to have gone away.  I have not felt any numbness yet, hopefully we can skip that.   Also, my neck has been killing me the last several days and I wonder what part that may have played in getting this attack.

Eventually I saw an ear nose and throat doctor and had tests run. No one seems to know why my earache but it always does, and the only thing that helps is sumatriptan, which works really well.

Due to my other psych meds (Paxil and Wellbutrin), my neuro sent me to a psychiatrist to have an assessment and determine if Amitriptyline was right for me. I just finished my second visit with the psychiatrist, and she decided to up the dosage to 50mg. We also discussed another option since my migraines are still so bad. (I had a bad one during the appointment that I rated a 7 out of 10.)

The option we discussed was something the psychiatrist’s previous mentor had used with great success. It is an Amitriptyline-Diazepam-Diclofenac intravaginal suppository for chronic pain. I gave her the weirdest look, but she assured me it was a thing. She found it on one of her medical portals, but a google search turned up nothing for her. She stated that she would research it some more and speak to her mentor who has used it as well. Then she will get back to me.

Like clockwork, I go to bed and start dozing off, and just as I'm about to fall asleep, I get flung into a suspended state of consciousness plagued with horrible hallucinations and night terrors. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I already struggle with those problems as it is. I have recurrent psychosis (my episodes are mainly triggered by stress and flare ups of other mental health issues) and I honestly thought that was bad enough. Now, though, I seem unable to sleep at all. My god... I don't know if it's worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hallucinate when I have bad migraines anyway, but nothing this terrible. Not to mention during the day, I'm jumpy, jittery, and full of anxiety - something I didn't really have to deal with before. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, episodes of insomnia have often lead to psychotic and dissociative episodes and I'm not at a place in my life where this is viable or manageable in any way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't sustainable and I'm terrified. I take 40mg in the morning and 40mg at night (I'm tiny and pretty susceptible to meds anyway, so even small doses make me feel odd). Should I stop taking the tablet at night? Will that reduce the effectiveness of the meds in preventing migraines (it's been great so far, aside from the side effects). If anyone has any advice, please let me know. ",,1,1

168,I'm reading 'Everyman' and this is how Philip Roth describes one of the characters. He's arguably one of the best American novelists of the 20th century for a reason.,"""Phoebe knew plenty about physical misery because of the severe headaches that she'd dismissed as nothing back in her twenties but that she realized were migraines when they became regular and frequent in her thirties. She was lucky enough to be able to sleep when she got one, but the moment she opened her eyes, the moment she was conscious, there it was—the incredible ache on one side of her head, the pressure in her face and her jaw, and back of her eye socket a foot on her eyeball crushing it. The migraines started with spirals of light, bright spots moving in a swirl in front of her eyes even when she closed them, and then progressed to disorientation, dizziness, pain, nausea, and vomiting. ""It's nothing like being in this world,"" she told him afterward. ""There's nothing in my body but the pressure in my head."" All he could do for her was to remove the big cooking pot into which she vomited, and to clean it out in the bathroom, and then to tiptoe back into the bedroom and place it beside the bed for her to use when she was sick again. For the twenty-four or forty-eight hours that the migraine lasted, she could not stand another presence in the darkened room, any more than she could bear the thinnest sliver of light filtering in from beneath the drawn shades. And no drugs helped. None of them worked for her. Once the migraine started, there was no stopping it.""

Before this year I was on continuous birth control. I thought it was helping, and I never had a period, so I never associated my migraines with my hormones while on it (and before I was on it, they were somewhat hormonal but mostly just unpredictable). They were just more or less constant all the time, but low intensity. Relatively easily treatable, but I can't take the abortives all the time. Due to some other side effects (plus the curiosity of whether or not coming off of it now would help my head), I decided to stop the birth control. My other side effects improved pretty substantially, which is great, but of course now my migraines have changed. 

Instead of being constant all the time, I get a horrible one every other day for the week leading up to my period, and then on the day before and day of, it's at its worse. It lingers and keeps coming back, even after repeated abortive medications, and the only really reprieve is waiting for my period to end. Then the migraines go back to every few days, until the 2nd week of my cycle after my period where I go a solid week, to week and a half, pain free. 

Rinse and repeat. I really can't figure out which is better: now or how it was? 

Because now I get a pretty decent gap of pain free days in the middle of the month and my other birth control side effects are gone, but the migraines I do get are now much more severe and hard to treat. Versus on birth control where it's constant, I have the side effects, but at least they respond to medications and have less severity. Feels like I can't win. Currently it's the first day of my period and I've taken both of my abortives, at the max allowed doses, and it keeps coming back after each dose. I know it'll get better once my period progresses but I'm sitting here just binging some of The Office with ice strapped to my head, in the bath, in the dark. Combined with the typical period cramps and cravings, I feel like crap.

Furthermore, I'm not a candidate for a lot of the common migraine preventatives due to other health problems I have and even if I wanted to go seek out more treatment (I certainly do), I can't because I just lost insurance from my parents, and I'm self employed so insuring myself is terrifyingly expensive.",,1,1

I'm basically at my wit's end. Aimovig is pretty much my last option (I just left my job over my migraines, which ironically, was to help get drugs like the anti-CGRP mAbs get clinical trial data). We have to appeal to Tricare to try to get them to cover it since they automatically deny authorization. It seems like a fair number of people have had luck with their insurance companies so far - has anyone had luck specifically with Tricare?

I'm actually considering find a new job now, which brings me a problem: How to let people know I'm not mentally weak?

Like I said, I have both migraines and cluster headaches. Both can be devastating, although migraine is so much better compared to cluster headaches. When I told my current superior about my health issues, he just told me that I am weak, both mentally and physically. Since his wife also have migraines, but it had never affect her life so much.

I don't know how to reply or refute him. Even Triptans does't help me much. For one worst combined **migraine-cluster headache** attack in my office I just fell down on the floor, crying and shouting. I know it's kinda embarrassing. But the pain was just so terrible and it's the only thing I can do. I'm sure I'm not mentally weak since I exercise regularly. I even had some hand-to-hand combat training back in college.

178,DAE get relief out of vomiting during a migraine?,"I’ve had migraines for as long as can remember, most likely caused by vision problems when I was younger and GAD/stress as well. Nausea is ALWAYS a symptom of my migraines. I get blurry vision, or what feels like someone pushing on my eyes as well, which increases the nausea. I used to get them on an almost weekly basis before I got glasses years ago, and that was horrible. Id get them after every football game and Id also puke on the bus/in the locker room lol. I’d dry heave until I had literally nothing left in me, but I noticed that it helped with the pain. I don’t get them nearly as often now (once or twice in a few months), but the nausea symptom is still just as strong. At this point, I actually force myself to vomit about an hour in. That’s around when it used to happen naturally for me, but it seems like they drag on too long. So, I either use my tongue or my fingers to gag myself and hang out by the toilet for a little while, until I finally empty out my fucking insides. I experience an immediate sense of relief. The pain is still there, just dull. 
I used to pop ibuprofen and other pain relievers for migraines and they’d do nothing to ease the intensity, but somehow vomiting works for me, and always has. Anybody else like this?

Edit: I’ve (as far as I can remember) never gotten rid of a migraine without vomiting first. It’s almost like it has to happen for the pain to subside.

As someone who is  'data driven' and has never been able to pinpoint my triggers, I feel the need to really try and figure this out.

He invited me to have some cocktail during lunch. Alcohol usually brings me into a terrible migraine. What made things worse was that the day was 2 days before my menstruation, when the worst attack happens in a month. I really wanted to refuse him. But I had to accept since I really didn't know how could I refuse an important client.

But my pain started to kick off in the afternoon, both migraine and cluster headache.

I recently visited the emergency room after an episode in which I lost all vision on my right side, as well as seeing black and dark blue ""smudges"" in my vision. This episode lasted about half an hour. 5 hours in the ER and one MRI later, they determined that the episode was most likely a migraine event. For the last few months, I've experienced chronic headaches, fatigue, brain fog, trouble focusing and irritability. I wasn't sure what the cause was, but it seems to be migraines.

Now here's the thing: *The headaches themselves aren't that bad.* When I think ""migraine"", I think of a severely painful headache. While the headaches are fairly persistent (I hardly go a day without at least a hint of a headache), they aren't severely painful. They're usually only 2-3/10 on the pain scale, and the pain is manageable with regular Advil or Tylenol. My issue is with the other symptoms; the fatigue and the brain fog. I feel like I can't focus, it's difficult to read or even hold a complex conversation with someone. Mentally and cognitively, I don't feel like myself. And I'm perpetually exhausted. I drink lots of water, eat a somewhat healthy diet, sleep well, and exercise fairly frequently, and yet the exhaustion and brain fog persist. I'm starting school in about a week and I just got accepted into a rigourous program. I'm worried the cognitive effects I'm experiencing are going to negatively impact me, and I really don't want that to happen.

These migraines have been ruining my life and wrecked my mental and physical health. I’m terrified of doing anything to cause me to get a migraine like any form of exercising, going to loud and bright places, and basically any sort of fun that doesn’t involve me being at home. It sounds silly but it feels like I have PTSD because of my migraines. I remember every instance my migraines have ruined a fun outing with friends and family and remember the horrible pain I was in. My migraines give me severe anxiety attacks as well and I freak out and want to die.

I apologize for being dramatic and I just felt like ranting and seeing if someone had any suggestions for help. I’m desperate and my depression and anxiety is through the roof and I feel hopeless. I’m so scared I’ll live with constant migraines forever, I just can’t live like this any longer. 
I’m getting an MRI of my brain and a EEG this week at least and I’m seeing a new neurologist.

Does anyone have ANY recommendations on how to help myself? I heard CBD oil or weed helps? I’ve been told that shrooms can help as well?
 Is there any hope I can be free of this pain finally?",,1,1
208,Nervous about upcoming Aimovig treatment .,I was excited until i heard Aimovig has been causing triptans to not work for some people. Most of those people are also having increased migraines.

209,Journalist request: Low-income &amp; seeking Aimovig,"Hi! I hope this post is allowed. I'm a writer with Splinter (splinternews.com). I'm a migraine sufferer and I've written about migraine in the past, talking to low-income women who get migraines about how they cope without paid sick leave. You can read that piece [here](https://splinternews.com/why-working-women-with-migraines-suffer-in-silence-1820243253).

I'm doing a follow up piece on Aimovig, looking for low-income people to talk to about the drug and their experience trying to get it. If you're low income (which is up to you to define, but the federal definition is less than $47k for a family of four), on Medicaid or Medicare, or entirely uninsured, I would love to talk to you.

211,Worst migraine,"Today I experienced my worst migraine to date. 

I started a job at a nail salon as a part time receptionist, 
Monday through Thursday. I thought this would be perfect since I have not been able to find work anywhere else because of my migraines. Boy was I wrong. 
Being 28 and never really having a job makes me feel less of a person. So when I came across this position I was ecstatic. 
Last week on Monday my migraine began and never quit the whole week. Today it came to an excruciating pain level. I have a high pain tolerance but this pain made me say uncle. I relented and went to a urgent care after work. 
I have had a migraine off and on ever since I started the job and it’s interfering with my ability to learn the job. I don’t believe I’m going to be able to continue with this job which makes me feel horrible and none contributing citizen. 
I just wish I could find a job that I can maintain and won’t put me into a migraine cycle. ",,1,1
212,work and migraines,I have had to take a year off to figure out my migraines because the job I had to leave was effected by my migraines. They have been getting better but I just have anxiety about losing another job to migraines... How have people kept their jobs and have had so many migraines? The issue is my migraines happen in the morning and by the time I take the triptan+pain meds I am knocked out for at least 4 hrs. I have at least a scattered 7-10 days of migraines that sometimes can be more depending on the month I have (hormonal migraines + triggered). Not *enough* for it to be 'too serious' but that's almost 120 days a year which is job costing! It's one thing to miss social things but then to miss work and then lose a job &gt; look for another &gt; cycle repeats. ,,1,1
213,First night in ER,"Oh fellow migrainees, I had quite the last 48hrs. Some of you might remember how I excited I was to finally have appt w/ neuro which then got canceled by no fault of my own last week. I had a new doc that I was planning on calling this week to set up an appt, when the worst migraine so far hit me Saturday. I lay in agony vomiting until that evening when I fell asleep. Sunday morn I felt better, until the afternoon came and the ominous ice pick feeling began on my left browbone. I felt like a lumberjack was hacking at the left side of my head with his tool. Still exhausted from the all day pain Saturday I just couldn't take it. I tried taking 20mg of tramadol that my GI doc had prescribed me when I was hospitalized w/ gastric/small intestine bleed due to excessive NSAID use for migraines and it had no effect. By 3am I was on my way to the ER. Thankfully no one else was waiting so I got right in (I dreaded the thought of waiting in a full waiting room for hours with the bright lights and other vomiters). The staff was SO KIND. They kept my light off and got me hooked up to IV &amp; sent me to CT scan quickly. They gave me Reglan, fluids &amp; benadryl via IV &amp; oral Tylenol. The reglan made me feel like I was going to jump out of my skin (ahhhhhh😱) but within 30 mins the pain was GONE. The ER doc wrote me a month supply for Fioricet &amp; Tylenol 3 and urged me to follow up w/ neuro. I called today and got appt for the 6th with one. I'm relieved to have the ER docs rxs to hold me over until my appt. (Was surprised that my insurance didn't cover the generic Fioricet ($50)). Anyways, I am on the beginning of my migraine journey &amp; grateful for all of you who listen patiently &amp; share your own advice &amp; experience.",,1,1
214,Glasses for light?,"Always extremely bright out where I live, the light when I get out of work in combination with the heart gives me a horrible migraine. My job requires me to stare at a screen, all day. I get home and stare at a screen, all night until I give it a break for six hours as I asleep. I have developed biting down hard, biting on towels, and other things just to ignore the pain behind my eyes and around the front of my head and sides of my head. I have a constant pain behind my eyes from so much light exposure and I get migraines that last three or four hours everyday, it's driving my insane and killing my work ethic. Are there any inconspicious, regular looking glasses that won't draw attention to me that block out light from screens? Sunglasses that are cheap and good for the sun? I don't wear glasses so they can't have any vision distortion, I just need a pair of glasses to block out or dim the light from the screen so it doesn't hurt so bad.

215,Best generic for topiramate?,"I’ve been on topiramate for six years and I don’t think it’s been doing me any favors for the last three. At first, it was amazing. I was on Teva generic and it worked great. I went from 25mg, to 50mg and then for the past three years 100mg. Somewhere in-between I got switched to Zydus and my migraines have come back. I go to Walgreens and they can’t order the other manufactures for me. I’ve called around, CVS carries Glenmark and a local supermarket carries ZyGenerics which is the same as Zydus. I don’t know which one is comparable to the name brand and I also can’t find the Teva generic (someone posted it’s at Costco, but they only carry SUN at mine). Some help here? ",,1,1
216,Reoccurring seizure description,"Hey there,

I created this throwaway account because I was planning to include some medical details I don’t wish to have associated with my main reddit account. I hope you understand that.

I wish to describe all parts of my migraine seizure since I had one yesterday evening again after having one a week ago, which is really frequent for me right now.

The thing that really frustrates me about migraines is that so many people have them, and for me the seizure always happens the same way with the same symptoms in the same order, that I find it hard to believe that nothing could be done to understand migraine further. I really think more research has to be done in that field.

# Symptoms

Those symptoms always happen in this same order, only strength and duration can vary.

1. (This one doesn’t always happen) The feeling of having an air head, can’t concentrate, having difficulties to focus my eyes on text (gets slightly blurry)
2. This is the main indicator of getting a migraine: I simply can’t see all areas in my field of vision. Especially if there is text or something should be moving but my brain didn’t process it. Those parts of my vision where I can’t see are fixed in angle, so when I move my head I can see something at the place where I didn’t see much before. This can be compared with looking into a bright spot for a moment and then not being able to see much where you got blinded in your field of vision.
3. Crystal looking structures start to flicker
4. While still flickering, my body starts to feel numb as if you had pains and needles in your foot, but usually in my entire arms, and my face.
5. The actual headache starts, pulsating pain in the frontal area of my head, with intervals of 10-30 sec I’d say
6. By this time the flickering is completely gone, still some headache: Feeling nauseous, in some cases having to vomit

# Aftermath

I just described the normal symptoms lasting for 2-6 hours, but it doesn’t stop there.

I have some aftermaths that can last from 1 day to 1 week.

Those are:

Slight dizziness

Being sensitive to noise and light

Having difficulties focusing

Quick movements (like standing up or turning) give me a sudden flash of headache, like during the seizure

# My medical and personal profile

I’m generally a healthy person, being slightly underweight.

I have migraine starting with my puberty (\~13) until this age (23) so far, the symptoms never really changed since then.

Seizures used to appear once or twice per year, but the last two years I have them more regulary, counting 4 this year already. All 4 happening since July.

Usually, I ride 20min of bike every day.

I wear glasses (\~ +6 dioptrines) and have something called microstrabismus.

Last year I got new glasses without prisms, which could be one of the reasons my migraines got worse.

I’m a university student so I’m also thinking that stress is another factor, although I also get migraines during holidays (like right now).

My migraines are not bound by place and time, I got them in different countries, and at different times of the day.

Morning, noon, afternoon, evening, even during the night when I’m sleeping (I already woke up once in the middle of the night because I had a seizure).

I’m sensitive to weather, and I noticed that most (but not all) of my migraines happen from a shift from bad to good weather.

But since there are so many weather changes here it’s hard to say that this is really a cause.

I generally have a low blood pressure, slightly high blood pressures easily make me dizzy.

I never took drugs, except for alcohol, nicotine and caffeine.

Although, I’m not a regular smoker (didn’t have any nicotine for years) and quit coffee also some years ago since it has a negative effect on me causing dizziness.

I drink alcohol occasionally (maybe every second week or so), but I drink black tea regularly.

# What did I try so far

My best practice is closing the shutters and going to bed straight away once I notice I get a migraine (which is usually phase 2 to 3).

So I’m trying to sleep most of the time during the seizure, which is only partially possible because of the headache and the nausea.

I put a bottle next to my bed so I try to drink some water in between.

When I'm only left with headache and nausea I sometimes ease my pain a bit by letting warm water flow down my feet and arms, but this only helps for a short time.

Over the years I had one EEG measurement and two MRI scans of my brain, none of those during a seizure.

All of these didn’t show anything out of the ordinary.

For the worst case I got some triptans prescribed, but they don’t work so effectively that I’m 100% sure that they are the reason I start to feel better after half an hour or so.

I also tried CBD, but without success so far.

I always tried to think of what I did, eat or drink before having a seizure, trying to find even the smallest patterns that could help me avoid having those migraines. But sometimes the seizures appear so randomly that there is not really anything I can pinpoint it to.

# How does it affect my life?

The worst thing about it is that it can happen any time, any where, and that I'm knocked down in place where ever it happens (since I can't really ride a bike or drive a car due to the vision-related symptoms).

It can happen on holidays, in the middle of a road trip (where I would have to stop immediately because it could happen that phase 2 makes me not see some cars any longer), during a job interview, or any other important appointment to come up.

I once had it at work, so the only thing I could do is lay down at my work place and rest for a few hours before I was finally able to go home.

I don’t try to think too much about it, but to a small degree I live in the constant fear of having a seizure, which would knock me out for one day completely.

The next 1 to 2 weeks I’m incredibly sensitive to anything that feels like the beginning of a seizure, even if I just can’t see a letter on a text for a moment because of being blinded by the light, or a change in blood pressure, making me worried I get another seizure.

Once I had two seizures with only one day in between. Since those seizures exhaust me so much, the second seizure was incredibly unbearable for me, making me depressed and even wishing to end it all. But life seems so much brighter afterwards, appreciating the times not having seizures (which is fortunately most of the time for me still)

I hope that detailed experience could help some understand their seizures more.

The ultimate wish would be that my report could go into some research of course, to make everyone’s life a bit more bearable.

224,Migraine Progression... Help/Advice,"Hello everyone, 

First time poster in here so please bare with me it's really long but I am really after some advice because I'm desperate!

I'm 24 years old female from Australia however I live in Europe. I have been a migraine (with aura) sufferer my entire life. I will give some background so my first one when I was about 3-4 years old and I would get this really weird thing thats called Alice in Wonderland syndrome - it used to scare the hell out of me as a child combined with the nausea/throwing up and blinding pain it was not a fun time. And I could always tell when I would get a migraine because of what dreams I was having (still the same today)
When I got into my early teens say 11-12 I started experiencing blind spots, heightened sense of smell, sounds, numbness/paralysis of one side of my body (usually hand - arm - face - then feet and legs) and occasionally like full blown mental confusion where I'd be saying something but what I was thinking I was saying was not what was actually coming out of my mouth or texting if that makes sense ... followed by the normal pain nausea ect ect. 
I would have 1 or 2 a month less if I was lucky more if I wasn't and it was manageable. I finally had it down to the perfect art - I could switch my body off to go to sleep once I woke up from weird dreams + aura and even if I only slept for 30 minutes it was generally enough ( also I had only ever had migraines while sleeping or waking up my entire life) to have most of the bad pain go and my head would hurt and I would have a migraine hangover and that's how it went for about 10 years. 

So here is my issue - in June 2016 I started to get migraines more frequently one a week to maybe a 3 time a week then I wouldn't have one for 2 weeks then have one every second day for a week so all over the shop but I was having a migraine more often than not. And it really annoyed me and made me feel horrible but wasn't much I could do so I kind of put up with it. 
However since about January 2018 I have had a migraine or a headache every single day. And my auras have started to changed which really scares me. I am back to having the Alice in Wonderland syndrome, I am smelling things that aren't even there! I hallucinate when I have a migraine now, I even fainted the other day and I have them any time of the day. I can wake up and 4 hours later have one or have one fall asleep wake up still have the same migraine. I have mood swings and floaty things in my eyes, I can't look at bright lights, led lights, sunlight, patterns! (legit like stripped tops or intricate designs on clothing, table clothes, curtains anything really) I have a stiff neck all the time + heaps more stuff. Like I have no idea what is going on. 

So has anyone ever had this happen to them? Thier migraine one day just became chronic and thier auras start changing? 
Or does anyone get a similar migraine? I've never met anyone who gets this but I'm sure there has to be some people.
I have no idea what I'm going to do as I don't like to take medication but I have an appointment with a new neurologist so I will see what they say.

Any advice please and thank you im going crazy I've just spent the last 6 days with migraines avoiding everything and it's ruining my life !! Xx",,1,1

15 mins from my house.  The next thing I know, I'm in an ambulance with EMTs watching over me and asking me questions about what I remembered or not.  They said they picked my up by the high school near my house (5 mins from my house).  So I had driven at least 10 mins while I blacked out since the last thing I remembered was the Walmart 15 mins away.  They found me bc I had hit the small building right next to the high school.  I had made a big dent both on my car and the building's brick structure was cracking all the way down from my impact.   I did not have any visible injuries, and I did not hit anyone inside the building.  The only thing I had was some whiplash and a mild concussion.  I also had a migraine afterwards.

243,Help and resources for my girlfriend,"I'm writing this sitting next to my gf in the hospital as she sleeps. She went to the ER this morning after a particularly debilitating migraine episode. She suffers from chronic migraines and they seem to have increased in frequency and intensity.

We're waiting on CT scan results, but my understanding is that those images will only help rule out large and obvious issues such as a tumor or blockages. Also, from what I've read, it is unlikely these images will have any great diagnostic value.

I have my own experience of dealing with a chronic and painful condition so I couldn't be more empathetic to what she's going through. How can I help her navigate finding the right health professional and landing on a treatment plan? From my own experience I know there is rarely a magic bullet to a health condition, but I don't know enough about migraines yet to offer any useful advice or strategies. I'm hoping that reaching out to this community can help point us in the right direction as I want to help her figure out the best plan of action as quickly as possible.

Are there headache specialists or is a neurologist the best bet? What is the communities pulse on the efficacy of conventional medicine (acute and preventative)? How effective/critical are more holistic approaches such as good diet, sleep and handling of stress? What are some of the 'gold standard' treatment plans? What do I likely not know that you wish you would have known earlier so that I can better help her?

A rundown of potentially relevant information:

- She recently started going to the chiropractor for some pinched nerves in her lower back. Her thoracic/lumbar vertebrae x-ray show a fairly signifigant lateral bending.

- Her cervical vertebrae show a classic 'military neck' alignment.

245,Migraines causing me to be delusional?,"Is this something that has happened to anyone here? 

I got the short straw genetically; my Dad gets migraines often, and my Mom is on medication 4x more powerful than mine that she has to take daily to keep herself from getting debilitating migraines.

I only need to take my medication when I have particularly bad migraines, but as of late, my migraines have caused me to become delusional, and sort of beside myself. Like, I know that I am delusional, I know that it will be fine once my medication kicks in, but I start blabbing incoherently, and the past couple of times have ended up calling friends in the dead of night asking for them to ""Make it stop!""

247,Suddenly Getting Aura?,"I’ve had migraines at least once a month since I was around 13 and now I am 24. Right now my migraines are chronic and I also get daily headaches. I have never had an aura before, but today I got one for the first time. It was like a band across my vision and very fuzzy and distracting. And of course shortly after I got slammed with a massive migraine. The aura itself only lasted about 10-15 minutes. 

My question is, how worried should I be about suddenly getting an aura? I know it’s not normal for migraines to change like this, and I already had an appointment with my neurologist coming up on Wednesday. ",,1,1

249,Does anyone have a non-stop temple headache with their occipital neuralgia?,"I have been diagnosed with occipital neuralgia about a month ago and had it for a month prior before I knew what it was so have had it for a total of 2 months now. The entire time I have had ON, I have also had a non-stop headache in my temples. More specifically the area above my temples in my hairline is where it has been tender to touch and of the past week radiating pain (I believe it is my auriculotemporal nerve.)  I also have pain on my left side lower jaw and it is tight. My SCMs on my neck are tight as well as the right side of my neck, which I believe is related to the ON as the tightness is near where the nerve starts. 

The temple headache was very severe at first and then has slowly gone down, first when I took a round of Prednisone (this was before the ON diagnosis and before I could see a Neuro) and then after my first round of nerve blocks with steroids (after the ON diagnosis from my Neuro). But the headache fluctuates everyday - some days are better than others. It doesn't respond to OTC meds and I just started nortriptyline 2 days ago for ""nerve pain and to sleep better"" according to my pain doctor.

So this whole time I have been thinking that the temple headache was related to the ON, however the ON has shown more improvement this week and the terrible &amp; painful muscle spasm in the back of my head has mostly disappeared (I can sometimes feel it very dully but it goes away after a few minutes). The usual trend has been my temple headache was getting better with the back of my head pain/ON, however about a week ago, as the ON was starting to feel even better, my temples flared up (maybe auriculotemporal nerve) making my headache feel worse. I catch myself touching the tender areas throughout the day so I know they are bugging me. Its more severe on my left side than right, but both temples near the hairline are flared up and tender. So I have some questions:

Can ON cause temple headaches or inflame the auriculotemporal nerve? 

Do I have something else going on along with the ON that are two separate things?

I'm supposed to see my pain doctor next week and she had mentioned before I could get temple nerve blocks. Is this a common thing?",,1,1

255,Triptans vs. Prophylactics,"On a cursory glance it seemed this topic had not been discussed in this way yet, so I thought I'd post to solicit some advice:

I [25M] have been suffering from migraines for 4 years. I treat them by taking triptans (typically relpax) at the onset, and suffer about 1 per week (sometimes more; usually related to sleep disruption). When picking up my most recent triptan prescription (27 doses, which I expect to last a few months), my pharmacist expressed his concern that I was too young to be taking triptans. **He was even more alarmed when I told him I was taking them once or twice a week. He said that due to their effects on blood vessels, by taking them so often I am decreasing bloodflow to my heart.** He noted that it is not sustainable to take them at this rate, that I certainly would not be able to take them at this rate when I reach 50, and that I may not even reach 50 years old if I continue to take them at this rate. He ended by urging me to take preventative prophylactics for my migraines rather than triptans to treat them. He was being nosy, and alarmist, but he seemed to know what he was talking about (especially with regard to triptan's mechanism of action). 

Unfortunately my neurologist is tricky to get in touch with and schedule appointments with so I lack the motivation to bring up this concern with her. Is it worth the effort?

**TL;DR: Pharmacist discouraged triptan use, recommending prophylactics instead; are his concerns valid?**",,1,1
256,Thank you for giving me the motivation to see a neurologist!,"I want to thank this subreddit for giving me the motivation to finally see someone about my headaches.

I always kind of thought there was nothing I could do about my migraines. I’ve had them my whole life, my dad’s always had them, and it was just something I always thought I should just “deal” with (even if dealing with it meant going to work, and taking a bunch of NSAIDS to get through the day, and then going to bed immediately when I got home).

I had my first appointment today and I LOVE my neurologist. I am amazed that he sat down and actually talked to me about what I was experiencing. He gave me a prescription for rescue medication, he listened when I said I didn’t want to be on a daily pill, and he gave me a list of preventative options I should research for myself and decide what I wanted to explore.

The thing I liked best, though, is that he helped with studies for different treatment options for migraines and is a migraine sufferer himself.

I have so much hope that I’ll eventually find a treatment method, and this was the BEST doctors appointment of my life.

Thank you all for giving the me the push I needed to see someone.

Tl;dr:  thanks to this subreddit I now have an awesome neurologist!

I could almost feel waves pushing me around and there was no stopping it.

The doctor did diagnose the issue as a migraine postdrome that has yet to fade (3 weeks in!!!). I was extremely relieved (though I'm not sure if they made sure my carotid arteries were clear as well... but that's the hypochondriac in me talking).

Regardless, together with the feeling of brain fog, fatigue and light sensitivity, I noticed that the side of my head that had the headache has been consistently hotter and warmer than the other.

I discussed trying it with my neurologist and filled all the paperwork at my last visit about oh two months ago now with little hope. I figured the worst was a no, so no harm no foul. All the nurses could tell me was, well nothing, as far as time for approval or word on yes or no from the company. 

I’ve never been so excited over a sharps container in my life. I safely assume this means my shots are on their way. I’ve already sent a half absent minded message to my neurologist on how to transition from my 50mgs of nightly topamax to the shots.

I live in Western WA, and with all the wildfire smoke, my migraines have been extra frequent/evil. I have BEGGED my PCP for tryptans dozens of times, but he deems the clotting risk too high I guess.

I get visual aura, light sensitivity, ear ringing, aphasia, pins and needles occasionally, as well as uncontrolled vomiting leading to dry heaves.....
I have 3 kids 6yrs and younger, I do not have time for this crap, I need relief.

In the past I have tried the basic OTC stuff, a few different tryptans, fioricet, acupuncture, acupressure, chiropractic, massage....I now also have an allergy to ibuprofen/NSAiDS.
When I do break down after a few days of pain, and go to an ER, they pump me with fluids and benendryl and call it a day. Not helpful.

Is there a course of treatment I'm missing?
I really want my Amerge back...so bad......does anyone know if the clot risk is really that big?

So I’ve been reading all of the threads and posts about Aimovig, and the medication just got approved for use in Canada in August 1st.

I’m eligible for supplementary (low income) health, but I’m not eligible for any private insurance due to pre-existing conditions, (not that I could afford it anyways since I’m a broke university student.)

I then moved on to propanolol for a couple weeks which didnt seem to help the migraines and it lowered my pulse to a unsafe low level so i had to come off it.

I then got moved onto topiramate which i am on now and they have been increasing the dosage each week. i have found that my ocular migraine frequency has decreased however the side effects with this tablet are different, im not sure if its just me but im finding it hard to have conversations and talk about things, im finding it hard to find the correct word to use.

Diclofenic ive been taking daily alongside topiramate to bring the intensity of the migraine down but ive found its harder to breathe than usual, im not asthmatic but i find myself getting out of breathe easily.

I get at least 15 migraine days per month, and Rizatriptan has essentially stopped working for me. 

The neurologist did not want to prescribe Aimovig, citing the high cost and his concern over potential cardiovascular issues that could be associated with taking Aimovig. Instead, he believes that I’m over-taking Rizatriptan and wants to switch me to Naratriptan and to start a 12 day round of Prednisone. Finally, he wants me to start taking Riboflavin 400 mg and CoQ10 300 mg each day. 

I’m concerned about taking the Prednisone. Though I know it’s only 12 days, when a medicine has a weight gain side effect, I always gain weight. Will 12 days cause significant weight gain?

I had never had it before, but now it’s just unbearable. I feel like I’m afraid at looking at the sky, thinking that I’ll see the stars and the process will start, slowly take me to that weird headspace that eventually turns into an inverse MDMA trip. 

It starts in the morning, almost everyday. I see stars in the sky, can’t really have my eyes open completely. Then I see these weird eye floaters. Then I see some weird white stuff (looks like lightning) but I’m not sure if this is aura - I usually see it when it’s over/mood swings are about to start. I get weird ASMR and goosebumps and crawling feelings everywhere (uncertain if I like it or not). 

My mood goes up and down. If I let the darker/sad consume me, the headache begins. Almost always on the same side - left side. Heart palpitations. Mood swings. Pain. Productivity and dopamine disappears completely. Then, I just feel crooked, sad and hate life. 

I took Sumatriptan for the first time pretty recently. 25mg x 4, one every hour. I’m not even sure if it helped me, but I didn’t have migraine the next day and it kind of disappeared towards bedtime the same day.

329,Reasonable accommodation for scent triggers: What has worked for you and your employer?,"Hi all,

I'm looking for advice in what to request for reasonable accommodation in terms of scent triggers. Has anyone been able to find a solution that works for them, their employer, and their coworkers?

Background: Scent is a really big trigger for me, and the only one I'm likely to encounter in the workplace (I work in an office). I've avoided asking for accommodation on this issue because I haven't been able to think of a way it could happen that didn't also feel like policing the actions of my coworkers (I don't want anyone to feel they can't use the hygiene/beauty products of their choice). Additionally, when I encounter a scent that is likely to be a trigger, I do what I can to accommodate on my own and limit exposure (sit as far away from a perfume wearer at a meeting, avoid small talk, etc).

However, there have been a few times that I have had a migraine triggered by a coworker who sits near me wearing strong perfume, and now it seems that an office near my desk is burning candles or incense. To be clear, these things are *not* problematic on their own, just the fact that they occur near my desk and mean I can't get away without leaving work.

Can anyone offer up a suggestion for an accommodation for scent triggers that has worked for them? Should I just suck it up and ask for a scent-free policy?

Thanks in advance!",,1,1

From the claims I have read it reduces inflammation and may lessen the symtoms of migrains.

Whole-Body Cryo

Our Whole-body Cryotherapy (WBC) treatments are a revolutionary method of cold therapy; exposing the body to subzero temperatures ranging from -200*F to -256*. During the 3 minute treatment, the body is cooled through the use of liquid nitrogen vapor that stimulates the skin’s receptors to constrict the blood vessels and rush blood back to the body’s core where it is oxygenated and enriched. Post treatment, blood vessels dilate and rush supercharged blood full of anti-inflammatory proteins, endorphins and oxygen activating all of the body’s natural healing ability.

TL;dr of my migraine hx: began having migraines around age 9. Very sporadic. Increased as a 17 year old and when on depo shot. Battled some severe ones until around age 24. Migraines trailed off and then about a year ago (I'm 38 now), they came back with a vengeance. Variations of pressure, neck pain, aura, tingling, loss of sight, aphasia, memory loss/amnesia, clusters, weakness, and headache. I see a neuro and take: 10mg nortriptyline and supplements suggested by my neuro. I'm 13 weeks into talk therapy. I quit smoking 4 days ago. I don't drink. I don't do drugs. I have an extremely stressful life. 

Currently: 3+ day headache in various stages. Saturday night I was able to just take Benadryl and naproxen and pass out which helped quite a bit but didn't kill the headache. Since my headache began late last week I'm noticing a new issue: eye twitch. Only my right eye. It is constant. It is bothersome. If I sleep 10 hours or 6 hours, it still twitches. I tried compresses as suggested by the web with no luck. I even lightly massage the area when applying my eye cream and nothing. I do wear glasses/contacts and have for 31 years.

334,Feeling frustrated,"I’ve been dealing with migraines for as long as I can remember (approx. 5/6 years old). I am familiar with my triggers (i.e., sugar, alcohol, heat, too much exercise, lack of sleep, etc.) and actively try to avoid them. However, occasionally, I’ll get intense barometric migraines brought on by changes in the weather. Personally, I self-medicate with cannabis. As it is illegal in the state I grew up in, I found ways around the antiquated prohibition laws and was able to control my migraines. Also, most people I know partake in using this substance, so it was always easy for me to get. As an adult, I have been able to control my migraines with cannabis and have been able to function normally.

I have recently relocated to a new country where cannabis is medically legal. I was so excited to be able to have legitimate access to the one medication that works for me. After visiting my new GP, I explained the severity of my migraines and how cannabis is the only thing I’ve found to work. Despite this, she told me that ‘marijuana is just a trend’ and she doesn’t just ‘hand out drugs.’ OK, seriously? So, I ended up leaving her office with a prescription for liquid painkillers (despite me trying to explain that I vomit when I get migraines and won't’ be able to keep the liquid down).

Sure enough, the following month I get a terrible 10/10 migraine while at work. I end up leaving early and make my way to the doctor’s office. With sunglasses on, a wet washcloth on my head, and a bucket in my grasp (in case I don’t make it to the bathroom in time), I explain through my agonizing pain that I need a prescription for my medicine. Despite seeing me in obvious pain, the doctor prescribes a NOSE SPRAY. I was literally shaking in her office, couldn’t hold my head up and had tears in my eyes (we all know how painful migraines can be).

I’m honestly curious how doctors take oaths to help their patients yet ignore or downplay their symptoms… They see a patient suffering in front of them yet so cavalierly say, ‘Oh, yeah marijuana hasn’t really been studied for migraines, so I can’t just give it to you. Here’s a nose spray.’

Needless to say, despite the nose spray, I spent two days at home, in bed, and out of work. I had to miss two days of work because my doctor is ignorant. Two days in my bed, shaking in pain, unable to go outside because of the brightness, unable to keep any food down... 

Makes me wonder why cannabis is even medically legal in this country if doctors aren’t educated enough to prescribe it to those who need it… Sad world.

I've been a fellow migraineur for the last 16 years. I average about 2 a week, but I can manage some triggers (ponytails, vanilla scents, too much sleep). 


For the last year or so, I've noticed a strange new symptom: after sneezing, I experience severe pain on the left side of my head. It goes from around my eye, through the left side of my skull, by my ear and near my neck. It lasts about 20 minutes and half of the time turns into a full migraine. I can trace the line it runs through on my head. 


Since I've become aware of it, I also notice it when I bend over and cough excessively. 


There's nothing I can do to ease that pain, either. I sit there and watch the clock waiting for it to go away.

I recently heard about navage and I became really interested. I read a bunch of reviews and comments hoping for people’s reviews on helping soothe their migraines/headaches, but I didn’t find much. 

This is my long winded way of asking all you lovely people: has anyone tried navage or have any experiences you’d like to share in regards to helping with your migraines/sinus headaches? I’d love some advice before I make the commitment to buy one or not. Any info would be much appreciated :) ",,1,1
342,I think im a migraine sufferer,"I came home Thursday from work with the mothers of all mother headaches. 
Im like my head felt like it was in a vice. I was talking to a few people after and they said it sounds like a migraine. 
For info im a 44 year old female. 

I Dr googled it and now im here to see if i should go see my Dr. 

Dr G symptom  bad mood or change of mood preceding. Wednesday i was in the foulest mood. Like really snappy and just a bitch
Dr G symptom. Wanting to eat starchy food. I went out specifically and got bread Thursday cos its all i felt like eating
Dr g sympt. Stars. Auras about an hour before. I actually said to my work colleague i think i need glasses as everything was “swimming” on the screen. 
By the time i got home my mouth was dry like the Sahara. 
About an hour later i was in tears as my head was killing me.

346,Pain (for the lack of better word) at the top right of my head,"Hi,
I'm 25, m. I've been experiencing this unusual pressure like pain at the top but slightly to the right side of my head for last couple of months. Sometimes I feel pinching sensation. Sometimes pressure. Sometimes it radiates to my right ear. Like it's not pain but it is definitely something. It's driving me nuts. Always there 24/7 even after I wake up. I can't think properly. I'm like a zombie. My emotions and thought process is dead. Also I feel neck stiffness and pain (on the same side) Tobacco use makes it worse. Painkillers/anti allergics have no affect on it whatsoever. I was thinking it might be sinusitis since I've occasional post nasal dripping but I don't have any other sign/symptoms of infection whatsoever.

347,Minor rant on menstrual migraines,"I've been subbed and reading for a few years now. 

I'm in the midst of wasting half of my weekend battling a migraine that started Wednesday, I think, because my period was ending. That's when the migraines are the worst for me. I also can get them when my period is starting. 

My neuro suggested the last time I visited that I take my Frovatriptan as a preventative measure by beginning it a day or two before I start my period then continuing until it's over. It's worked the past few months in the sense that if one starts, I can kill it pretty quickly by then also using the Frova as an abortive.

Well ... this month I started two days early, and I hadn't started taking the Frova yet. :( Evidently the preventative measure was working because now this thing won't go away no matter what I try.

It was a pain (ha!) to take out of my ear. I still live with my migraines heavily controlled by Imitrex (sumatriptan) and Topamax (topiramate).

351,Migraines Since Childhood,"TLWR; going to see neurologist for migraine management - any insight into what may happen?

I've had debilitating migraines since I was ten years old; a lot of serious head injuries occurred during this time - had a ten pound ice block broken over my head, fell on ice and smashed my left eye socket and temple on a metal railing, amongst constantly being hit in the head by an abusive parent. I don't know if these incidents are coinciding but they are events that I personally would say gave me problems afterward - like the headaches. They take hours to go away, sometimes even lasting for days and I used to deal with them by taking Advil or Excedrin because Tylenol wasn't working, but in the last year, I've suddenly become allergic to any NSAIDs - I break out in a full-body rash. So, now I am forced to deal with my migraines, unaided, and it has become a serious problem because I am forced to either experience the worst migraine ever (along with vomiting, chills, sensitivity to light and sound), every single week, or take the Advil with an antihistamine and hope I don't go into anaphylactic shock.. My doctor advised me to see a neurologist, so I am, but I am unsure of what they could even do for me. I don't know much about treatment options and don't want to go in blindly.

I have a child and school to worry about, so I can't deal with this anymore. Any advice is appreciated!",,1,1
352,Left eye feels offset after a migraine - breaking the perceived center axis of my body,"I wanted to ask if anyone has ever heard of or faced a minor problem that has been bugging me ever since my worst migraine attack from last year. Story time.

I always thought that there would not be any lasting after effects caused by migraine episodes. There never were any for me before - not for the 20 years that I have been having migraines.

My migraines usually hold from 6 to 24 hours maximum but around 1 year ago, what I brushed off as another usual inconvenience, became 2 days of agony. In the middle of the second day, the vision in my left eye was still gone and the pain made me wail and gave me thoughts of smashing my head against the wall next to my bed.

This was my worst attack ever and only started to wear off in the early morning of the third day.

Unfortunately, the vision in my left eye still felt weird, with weak overall vision. I went to a clinic for an MRI scan and to have my eyes fully checked shortly afterwards, but in the end both came out clean and fine.

Fast forward to this day and I am still struggling with the feeling that my body is off center. 

I can walk, run, my coordination is as good as always but when I sit in the car or in front of the computer, it feels like I'm not sitting straight. As if one of the eyes was crooked or cross-eyed, or the eye itself was not placed in its eye socket but offset to the side, somewhere my body awareness doesn't expect it to be.

Even when I sit straight and properly in the center of a chair or a car seat, I have the feeling that I am not sitting straight and my body tries to subconsciously adjust itself to sit straight but breaks my posture instead.

I am sorry if this came out as rambling but this is a really difficult issue for me to describe as a non-native speaker. I wasn't able to find any information corresponding to my problem with google either.

I am planning on seeing a neurologist again to see if they can think of a cause for this oddity.",,1,1
353,"23F, Sudden frequent migraines","Hey there. 

I'm not sure if I'm posting in the correct place, if so please direct me to some help. 

Since around the beginning of 2018 I've been experiencing frequent migraines (2 or 3 per month). I have recently, within the last 2 months or so, began trying to narrow down the cause but I haven't been able to put my finger on it. It seems to be slightly more likely to happen around my menstrual cycle and during periods of stress. I've just begun student teaching and I've had 3 in the last 2 weeks.. they're usually like a band around my head, really focused at the base of my head on the back of my neck (if that makes sense) I have light sensitivity, fatigue, and noise sensitivity when experiencing one. 

I have spoken with my psychiatrist (I see her most regularly for ADHD medicine refills) and she just prescribed me a medication. I have not used the medication because I find that Excedrin Migraine usually does the trick.  I also take 40mg of Vyvanse, 40mg Viibryd, and 20mg propranolol a day as well as a Nuva Ring for birth control, if that helps. 

Please let me know if this is cause for concern or if you have any insight on what could be triggering these and any tips or relief. ",,1,1
354,Interrupted dinner,"Last night I went out to dinner with my boyfriend. I had a migraine. The right side of my head was throbbing and I lost my appetite.

358,"diagnosed today, would super love some hope.","i'm new here, hi, hello! i went into my doctor after a weeklong migraine that was accompanied by a complete inability to focus/depersonalization/hella sensitivity and pretty terrifying depression.  it's not my first rodeo with mental health challenges, but fuck, this was unpleasant.

i've suspected this is what i'm dealing with for a while, but after talking with my doctor today, the pieces of my entire life as a chronically ill person came together in a way that is hard to wrap my head around.  i can't...believe...it's all...been migraine? this whole fucking time, probably?

the debilitating, fairly chronic attacks started when i stopped drinking 4-5 cups of coffee a day (cold turkey, never went back), which my doctor thinks is why it wasn't obviously earlier that this is what i'm dealing with.  she thinks i was self medicating without even realizing it.  

anyways, this news gives me both a sense of relief and one of total dread.  i am trying so hard to give myself hope that i can find a way to manage this, but the whole process seems completely daunting and frankly terrifying.  i'm not asking for a cure, or only happy endings--but i would appreciate any earnest words for a newbie in the way of hope.  thanks &lt;3 ",,1,1

363,"Odd symptoms, possibly related to migraine?","Hello all! I’ve recently developed some odd symptoms that are a little bit scary, and I’m just trying to figure some things out. I want to preface this as well by saying that I’ve already seen my doctor, and have an MRI scheduled for this coming Tuesday, as well as an appointment with my neurologist on the 23rd. 

Also, as a warning, this post is rather long.

So, about a week ago I had two migraines fairly close to each other. This was nothing out of the ordinary; I go through these weird cycles where I’ll have multiple migraines in the span of a week and then proceed to not have any more for a month or two. Nothing was different about these two migraines either, and they responded as usual to my medication. However, after the second one, I noticed that my hands were rather shaky at times. I chalked it up to simply being the postdrome of my migraines. I went about my day as usual, but also noticed that my legs felt like they were shaking or vibrating any time I laid down. These symptoms continued into the next day, but I continued to ignore it. When they persisted on the third day, however, I saw one of the doctors at my local clinic. He didn’t really make any sort of diagnosis, but told me I might simply have essential tremor. Later that day I took a nap, and when I woke up, it felt as though the left side of my head was vibrating internally, and my face felt odd, as if it was burning or tingling under the skin and near my left eye. This had also occurred during my migraines before, so I tried to tell myself it was just related to that. At this point I started to become worried, and, obviously, started consulting Dr. Google. I quickly came to the conclusion that I was dying of a brain tumor, and rushed to the ER the next morning. The doctor there performed a very basic exam, and tested my reflexes, muscle strength, pupil dilation, and basic coordination... all of which came back fine. He diagnosed me with anxiety and gave me Celexa and Propranolol, both of which help to keep my anxiety from freaking me out but do nothing to ease my actual symptoms. Then today, I decided to go back to my local clinic, and saw a different doctor there. She’s the only one who seemed to take me seriously, and told me that it seemed that there was a possible connection to my migraines, and scheduled my MRI for as soon as possible. 

As it stands now, it’s felt like I’ve been having a mild, constant migraine for a day or so, coupled with occasional waves of tremors and occasional nausea. I’ve done research and am leaning towards it (hopefully) being a complex migraine, or some type of vestibular or hemiplegic migraine, rather than something particularly scary. Has anyone had similar symptoms that turned out to be migraine related? ",,1,1

368,Constipated from Aimovig? Try these natural remedies!,"I've learned a lot from being chronically ill (POTS, intractable migraine, EDS). Here are some very helpful tips I wish I had years ago when I suffered with chronic constipation. All natural, as it should be. (Un-natural substances like Miralax and Colace work great for quick acute relief but make things worse over time as your body will depend on them).

\*NOTE: If you are so constipated you haven't had a BM in days and are in agony- USE AN ENEMA. Adding any food is going to sit at the top of the stomach and make things worse. Once things get moving, things get moving. I preferred saline enemas.\*

TEAS: Nettle is soothing and great first thing in the AM or when you feel lots of abdominal irritation. Dandelion Root tea is very bitter which stimulates bile production therefore getting digestive juices flowing, best when you feel really stuck. There are also laxative-specific teas like Smooth Move but they're gross.

PROBIOTICS: Self explanatory. I use 100bu which is very strong but 30-60bu can work wonders.

BARLEY GRASS JUICE POWDER: Add to smoothie, often miraculous. Fine in water but tastes gross.

FIBER: Add ground chia and flax seeds to smoothie with BGJP powder. Nutiva also makes a ""high fiber"" Hemp Protein powder which is great. Key is to MINIMIZE animal products as they are much harder for the gut to break down. Eat mostly plant based as possible.

SLIPPERY ELM: powder made into tea works best but you can also take capsules for when you're on the go. Soothes the inner intestinal walls making it easier for things to pass. It's also like a natural Prilosec that is good, not bad, for you. It helps with heartburn, GERD, diarrhea etc.

NATURAL LAXATIVE supplements: Use aloe vera (juice or capsules), Senna, or pre-made tablets like ""Natural Laxative"" By GAIA herbs.

DIGESTIVE SUPPLEMENTS TO TAKE AT MEALS: Digestive enzymes, Betaine HCL with Pepsin

ABDOMINAL MASSAGE: So simple but overlooked and effective. Gently, deeply massage all over the abdomen as you lay in bed before sleeping. Focus on the tender areas (usually around belly button). Also lots of videos/images online of helpful acupressure points on the body.

OTHER: Apple Cider Vinegar, fermented foods, straight celery juice OR warm lemon ginger water upon waking, yoga, swimming, epsom salt baths, magnesium (oxide is the least absorbed form which makes it the most laxative form, aka it goes right though you)

Hope this helps! Happy to post more info/brands etc. Best wishes on your Aimovig journey.",,1,1

374,Half a beer triggered a mild migraine..,"25 years old, F. I’ve had migraine for years but never officially diagnosed (my doctor just agrees that they are migraines). 

Anyway, the past 2 years I get a migraine from even looking at alcohol. Last night I went out with some friends and had half a light beer and drank 2 large cups of water to avoid dehydration. I had 3 meals that day. 

I woke up in the middle of the night overheating with a mild migraine behind my eye and was super dizzy and felt drunk. This has happened on and off most times I drink. It feels similar to when I drink 5+ shots of hard alcohol back in my college days. It’s such an odd feeling. 

Needless to say, I’m giving up alcohol because I can’t predict the effects. Sometimes I’m fine with whiskey on the rocks or gin and tonic but other times I get a severe hangover and migraine. I suppose alcohol and I are breaking up for good.

375,Anyone feel like their eyes just arent quite right after a migraine (hemiplegic),"I had, what is believed to be a hemiplegic migraine on sunday night.

Felt fine all day at work, on the way home, started to get the aura. Expected normal migraine so took two neurofen and went to bed.

An hour later i woke up vomiting, unable to speak, pins and needles down my body and unable to use even a phone. When i spoke it came out gibberish. Luckily it was the third time in my life this has happened, so i knew it wasnt a stroke, but i got taken into hospital anyway and stayed the night. 

Brain bleed was discounted, and i refused the spinal puncture to test for miningitis.

I still have a mild headache, 4 days on. I was prescribed sumatriptan in case it happens again.

I dont remember the effects lasting this long, and i still cant stand bright lights, 4 days on. My eyes just dont feel right. It kinda feels like ive got an aura, but an aura isnt there? it sounds odd, and i can use a computer or watch tv fine, but my right eye just feels a tiny bit weird.

I wear glasses and now they are making my headache if i go outside in them.

Is this just part of the slow recovery from a bad hemi, or has something caused some permanant damage maybe?

377,Aspirin Advice,"**Bit of background:** I'm 31, have suffered migraines since puberty when they were at their most debilitating - around 1 a fortnight, lasting usually around 7-8 hours with nausea etc. This frequency lasted around 5 years, after that the I was getting maybe 1 a month..

So around 3 years ago I ran into another lady who suffered them and said she had started taking 1 aspirin every night which supposedly cured her. Now granted I'm a huge sceptic, I decided to try it and as it happened, the frequency of my migraines dropped to what it is now, around 2-3 a year. I've also discovered that playing sport and reaching a point of physical exhaustion is a huge trigger for me which I think has also contributed to the drop in frequency (I no longer play competitive sport and manage my fitness better). I also drink significantly more water now than I used to as I feel like that may have contributed. 

**My question:** Do you think it's time to stop taking an aspirin every night? Is taking this medication detrimental to my health or is it fairly low risk? 

Basically, I don't want to be reliant of taking a tablet every night. Especially if it's not actually doing anything and I'm just growing out of this issue naturally.",,1,1
378,Had what I think was my first migraine + postdrome... Anxious about brain bleeds.,"Just had what I think is my first migraine headache about two weeks ago. I have had ocular migraines (aura that obstructs vision in an eye for about 30 minutes without the pain) a number of times before, but this was the first time I had headache pains only. There was a pressure on my temples and a pressure behind my left eye. This lasted for only about 10-15 minutes before easing off. Needless to say, this scared the crap out of me and I did the unthinkable... I Googled... And of course, I found out that high blood pressure (which I'm taking medication for) can lead to bleeding in the brain. The thing is, I also found out that migraines can also cause similar symptoms. Could this just be a migraine?

For one, migraines are characterized by pressure/pain behind an eye, which is what I had. However, from what I understand, they aren't usually so sudden and last much longer than just minutes. The good news is that it wasn't that painful as I've heard that bleeding in the brain is extremely painful. In addition, I've had migraine auras a couple of times before without the headaches and one of my parents has chronic migraines. However, I also read about sentinel bleeds... where a small bleed in the brain can signal a bigger bleed to come. Another piece of good news is that there were no neurological side effects that I could notice. No droopy eyelids, no weakness, numbness, paralysis or abnormalities with my vision or pupillary response. 

The thing is, 2 weeks later, I’m getting scared that it was something more serious than a migraine as I’m still feeling light sensitive, tired, moody and a little sore here and there in my neck and head. In fact, it seems that staring at screens and my room lights make all the symptoms worse to the point of triggering nausea and panic attacks. Something else I've also noticed is that the symptoms seem to get better after a meal and that the side of my head that had the pain is still warmer/hotter than the other. Is that a sign of increased blood flow from damage?

Could this be the postdrome? The anxiety I've been experiencing? Or could it still be bleeding? Urgh... I'm terrified. The thing is, went down to the A&amp;E a couple of days ago for my panic attacks and was even admitted for observation. Three different doctors didn't think much of it after a quick check of vision and reflexes  because I wasn't showing any of the classic symptoms associated with brain damage or stroke. This could also because of my relatively young age of 28.

I can only go down to the GP in a week for another try due to my work schedule. Should I request for a CT scan or MRI? Has anyone experienced post-migraine symptoms that lasted this long and were this severe? Thank you very much for your support and advice in advance!",,1,1

My usual test is to focus on a light for 30 seconds and walk in a straight line.  If I can't do both of those things, I can't drive.  But I passed both of those today. (I guess bc I really wanted to get out of the house for the first time in days.)  So I don't know now.",,1,1

386,Aimovig unintended side effect?,"I’m less than a month into my first dose of Aimovig and it’s been working quite well for me so far (I’m remaining cautiously optimistic..!). In that time I’ve gone to two events where I had a few drinks (2-3).  Before Aimovig I would have definitely felt the effects the next day. However - these last two times, no hangover. At all. Non existent.

I’m curious to know if this is a fluke, or if the way Aimovig works would have actually caused me to process the alcohol/hangover different. I ask because I feel like I constantly having to turn down engagements because of how severe the fall out would be. It takes very little for me to feel real crappy (booze, noise, smells, motion can all make me feel ‘hungover’ and trigger migraines) and I would love to be able to have an occasional mimosa at brunch or beer at a basketball game again without the fear. I’m being selfish here - but the depression from not being able to be as social as I’d like or spend as much time with my family/friends is a real thing.

I can feel them coming most nights so I'm pretty much taking panadol every day at the first sign and only taking aspirin or nurofen if I really need it. 

My migraines get worse when I'm stressed out and while I get them a lot around my period as well and my hormones are a bit fucked. I also have PMDD, endometriosis and possibly adeno and just had a lap and IUD insertion to diagnose and treat it (I find out next week what was found). I used to get maybe one every few months but now I'm getting a few each week. I'm eating a drinking enough too. Also noteworthy is most of them are cluster migraines and I sometimes have an aura too (usually my sense if smell goes and I get stinging in my nose like I'm breathing in cold air even when it's warm. I know my neck and my posture isn't helping and going the chiropractor will reduce them a bit but not a lot. May just have 2 or 3 less migraines a month.

I'm wondering if I'm at a stage where I should see a neurologist. I know I'd need a referral from my GP and that's fine.

now i tend to be quite paranoid about extreme pain in any case so i also do my own research. i’ve found a few charts showing where you feel different types of headaches and the placement of my pain is more where it says pressure headaches are than migraines. 
also just a weird observation, i have some pain meds from a car accident and i took one the other day for a super severe headache because i didn’t have anything else in the house and it didn’t do much other than make me fall asleep but then i went and bought advil the next day since it didn’t go away and the advil kicked it. my only solution to that is the fact that the advil has an anti inflammatory.

My old ENT (moved states) had me on 2mg of Valium as needed that worked but my neurologist is anti Valium and Benzos since they can be addicting and people build up tolerance. I totally understand her stance but I do not abuse prescription pills and I refuse to  take things like Vicodin/Percocet/oxy when prescribed since it makes me sick and gives me awful stomach cramping. I just took Tylenol or Motrin for a previous surgery and wisdom teeth extraction (all 4 at once). I’m just saying that as an example of me not abusing medicine and I have no history of addiction.  I tried nortriptaline for 9 months and still had vertigo plus I gained a bunch of weight so I’m not going back on that. She prescribed me a small dose of some blood pressure meds she says works (I haven’t picked it up yet and can’t remember name) and told me to also take Dramamine (just made me very dizzy and tired).

409,Grrrrrrr...,"Hi all. I need some perspective. Or maybe talked off the ledge. Or maybe just commiseration. 
I'm 41, have had a daily headache since I was 16 and migraines since I was in my 20s. Over the years I've had 6 different PCPs, two neuros, three chiropractors, one reflexologist, had acupuncture, saw a naturopath, given a fair go to 15 prescription medications (some more than once), tried every supplement/vitamin ever suggested, I've adjusted my diet (cut all caffeine, tried keto, tried gluten-free, tried dairy free), I've done daily meditation, regular exercise. I felt like I was fairly well-educated on the subject until yesterday.
I haven't been taking anything other than tylenol for my headaches for the last three years (because pregnancy/breastfeeding). I only take tylenol when the pain is truly unbearable and never for repeated days. The ""novelty"" of this is wearing thin and I decided it was time for a new approach and a new neruo. So I found a guy that is a headache specialist, offers botox and medical marijuana (two things I have not yet tried).
Guys. I wanted to punch him in the face.
He had me fill out this long-ass diet form. And he immediately zeros in on the caffeine. I drink one cup of black tea with breakfast and will have a soda occasionally. He says no more caffeine. I tell him I have gone that direction before (for over 6 months) and saw no change. But I'll do it again if he says so.
He asks what kind of exercise I get. I said I run around after a two year old. He says that doesn't count. (I'm guessing that if he has children he wasn't very involved when they were 2 because these little fuckers get around). We walk, ride bikes and are at the playground every day. I walk more than five miles most days. I can't tolerate any exercise with impact. I can do yoga on good days. He says I need to do yoga every day. He was saying how exercise improves mood and mood can affect pain. Then he says ""who makes you mad?"" and I was like ""um....everyone?"" He then lectured me on how I am the only one who can control whether I'm mad. That other people do things and it's my choice how I react. I obviously understand this...it lacks practicality though. So the next time my two-year old shits on the carpet, or bites my leg or just won't fucking listen, I'll simply choose to not be upset about it?? Sure, ok.
He asked if there was a ""Planet of the Apes"" near me. He then turned to his nurse and said ""what do I mean?"" She said Planet Fitness. He told me to find one and join. ""It's only $10 a month"". Sure it is. But the nearest one is 30 miles away.
He says he wants me to only take 800mg of ibuprofen for pain. He asked what I usually take and I say that prior to pregnancy I would take Excedrin Migraine or Goodys. He literally gasped and recoiled. He said ""SO MUCH CAFFEINE!!"" He made me feel like I had just said I shoot up heroin and kick puppies for pain relief.
Ibuprofen doesn't do shit for me, but I'll give it a go.
He said he wants my vitamin D levels checked and asked if I had ever had them checked before. I said yes, that I had it checked several years ago and my doctor said it was low. He said, ""So did you just stop taking it?"" (meaning a supplement) and I said that I was not prescribed anything for it. He started laughing and said ""why do you people go to such horrible doctors?""
He asked if I had ever seen a neurologist before. I told him the two that I had seen. He said one was a pediatric neurologist and the other was in pain management. And that neither were headache specialists. I was like, ""Yeah, well, that's who my pcp referred me to.""

Maybe he caught me on a ""sensitive"" day but this dude pushed my fucking buttons. He made me feel small and stupid. Obviously we come from very different worlds. 

Oh and he had a fucking parrot in the office that was screeching the entire time. Super fun for someone with a migraine.

Ever since I received a concussion in football back in highschool I have been a sufferer of Migraines. I am unsure whether that its because of the concussion or I just grew into them shortly after.

My migraines have a very strict pattern, first its pupil dilation, numbing in the right side of the body (usually the hand first), then foot, then lip, followed by a piercing headache (a headache I still have today). But this new symptom was the scariest one yet... I was texting my GF at the time and I couldn't remember how to spell simple words. It occurred right before the headache. Simple words were impossible to spell and I couldn't think straight. I just could not picture the word in my head and I wasn't typing anything close to the word I wanted. I don't really know how to describe what happened and I want to see if anyone else has experienced anything like it. 

Any thoughts or comments would be helpful! To ease my mind.. I am debating on if this incident is enough to warrant a trip to the doctor as this was a brand new symptom..

426,Daily chronic headaches and neck tension advice,"hey fellow redditors,  


My name is Martin I´m 16 years old and i suffer from daily tension headaches and migraines for about the last 4 years.  
I might have a clue where my headaches are coming from. I suspect my neck is the main problem because i constantly feel very tense around that area and when i get migraines my neck feels even worse.Furthermore iv´e recently tried sleeping on two pillows and my pain the next morning was lighter than usuall. I´ve tried to loosen it up with neck and upper trapezius stretches i´ve found on youtube but i dosen´t seem to help with the headaches. The only thing that happens is that my head starts to tingle and the neck feels better for a moment.   


Some other things I tried are: chiropractor, posture exercises for about 2 weeks, swimming regualary since a a week,physiotherapie but he only massaged and stretched my neck area, acupuncter  


My neck tension probably comes from my heavy computer usage but i don´t seem to have forward head posture. but  i do have mild rounded shoulders  and my shoulder blades are sticking out more than normal which might be coming from my mild scoliosis.  


I´d appreciate any advice for further treatmeant or specific exercise routines which might help me become pain free :)

If I don’t finish school I’ll never make enough money, but who’s to say I’ll be able to keep any job when migraines come so randomly. How do y’all deal financially? I’m really worried about money, I overheard one of my roommates talking to my other one about kicking me out since I was short on rent last month because I stayed home a lot with migraines.

430,Getting cervicogenic headaches from chin tuck exercise,"I’ve been trying to reduce my chronic neck and shoulder pain following a whiplash injury a number of years ago. 

One common recommendation is the Chin Tuck or neck retraction exercise that pulls the chin back and is supposed to lengthen the cervical spine. 

However, within a few days of doing it (a few sets a day) I always get cervicogenic headaches and some light dizziness. 

What’s strange is that any research I’ve done indicates that doing this exercise is supposed to help with these symptoms, not trigger them. 

Has anyone else this experience?

431,Neurosurgeon says scar tissue can be contributing to migraines and headaches ...,"So I've been a  chronic migraine sufferer for the past 2.5 years. In addition to a cholesterol granuloma contributing to inflammation my neurosurgeon suggested that scar tissue might be the cause of the pain and pinching that is in consistent spot on top right of my head and spans out in a line toward the front and the back of head. He told me that massage might relieve the pain. So until I hear back if my insurance will cover a massage therapist, I bought one of those hand held scalp massagers and used it for about 1/2 hour last night. He said to try and move the tissue between skin and skull around to loosen it. I've been getting migraines all week but today I have a migraine behind left eye and head ache on right side as if I hit my entire right side of head against something. I've never experienced both sides in pain at same time before. Usually headaches turn to migraines but all on one side. I created more pain and I did not get relief. I hold back from exercising as this brings on pain at that point on right side which has turned into migraines. Even if I accidentally run over a pot hole while driving it doesn't necessarily start headache but it causes pinching and buzzing sensation. Does  anyone have similar symptoms or has been given similar diagnosis and any suggestions on what to do? He said surgery is an option but the surgery  itself may just cause more scar tissue. As for surgery for the cholesterol granuloma, it is stable and he said it is complex surgery because of its location. He wants to wait until my vision gets bad enough and I start seeing double. Any suggestions would be appreciated! ",,1,1
432,Noise-Induced Migraines -- any suggestions for coping?,"There are a couple of noises that trigger migraine headaches for me. My former roommate's excessively loud voice and his eating sounds were more than enough for the two years I shared an apartment with him and two others.

The main one is snoring. Snoring produces such an unpleasant sensation for me. It almost feels like someone is unzipping the back of my head. The longer the snoring goes on, the worse I feel. It feels like this every time. After a few minutes of listening to it, I get a nasty headache and don't feel any form of relief until it's completely stopped and I've taken something for it.

Noise-cancelling stuff doesn't really help. I have to completely drown out the snoring to the point where I can't hear it if I want any relief (I already have some hearing problems, so I'm sure that having to listen to stuff at a high volume isn't helping either). It keeps me awake and causes migraines. It also makes it hard to focus on anything if I can hear it even a little. It's so frustrating.

Desensitization through exposure has not helped even a little bit. The more I hear snoring, the more it sucks. The same was true with my roommate's ice-eating and other irritating habits. Tired of being tired.

Does anyone have suggestions that don't involve exposure therapy?",,1,1
433,[UPDATE] Heading to the ER for my first time. Wish me luck!,"**OG post: [Heading to the ER for my first time. Wish me luck!](https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/96st4k/heading_to_the_er_for_my_first_time_wish_me_luck/)**

Last night, I went to a free-standing emergency room for a 4 day migraine. I knew it wouldn't go away because last month I got the exact same migraine for 17 days with no relief. This ER had very few patients there. **If you have a free-standing ER near you, go to it! You'll get more attention and better treatment.**

I had the typical fears of going to an ER: how long will I just sit around waiting, aggravating the pain? Will they think I'm trying to swindle for narcotics? Will I actually get some relief?

Luckily, I had a great experience... well, for being at an ER and all. Everyone on the staff was incredible kind, personable, empathetic and helpful. I was in and out of that place in less than three hours.

**Now, onto the medical treatment...**

The nurses got right to work with getting a detailed patient history, preparing blood work, and setting up my IV. The doctor put this in my cocktail: Fioricet (two pills), Compazine, Decadron and Bendaryl. She said if those weren't helping my pain after about 30 minutes, they would give me Hydrocodone. I started feeling so much relief after the IV, but I still needed a little more for my pain. They gave me one Norco pill and I was pain free the rest of the night.

**But, unfortunately, this story doesn't have the happiest of endings.**

I woke up today feeling the same pain over my right eye. I think the steroid they gave me last night just wasn't enough. I've already talked to my neurologist about starting a 3-5 day Prednisone course. I'm almost positive this will relieve my pain.

**In my opinion, I think it's really important to go into the ER with relevant doctor notes that say what you've tried in the past, what's worked and what hasn't.** I had a spreadsheet listing every medication I've thrown at my migraines, including a smaller list of my current medications. This streamlined the process immensely. You never know what kind of ER you're gonna walk into. I've read about a lot of ERs treating migraineurs like trash. Better to be prepared.

Oh!! And how could I forget the most exciting news of the freakin' century! (Well, for me, anyways. Still holdin' out for my homies on the waitlist. Your time will come.) My first Aimovig shipment will be here in two days!!!!!! I'm so incredibly excited. I haven't felt this hopeful or happy about anything in a really long time.

435,How do you maintain a healthy &amp; loving relationship with your SO?,"Hi all, 

I need your support.  

I am a husband (m) of a migraine sufferer (f). We have 2 kids together. 

The youngest is just 1 year old and it’s during and after the birth  when my wife started to get more frequent migraines. 

Now it feels like they are 1-2 every week. And it is really hard on both of us - she is suffering and because of all the pain has a deep depression. And for me - it is a feeling of constant exhaustion. 

She is not working at the moment and I am sole provider. When she has migraines (sometimes a few days long) all the household stuff, cooking and taking care of the kids (and her as well) is on me. 

I don’t mind, my work hours are flexible, but it makes it all so much much harder  and in the end of the day there is just a feeling of exhaustion. 

Our relationship is becoming worse and worse. 

There is no closeness, love life is non existent and we are growing more and more apart.   
I love her to pieces and would not want to loose her.

So I wanted to ask you all - how do you keep your relationships from falling apart? What do your SOs do or what would you like them to be doing?  ",,1,1

I find out that he may tries to get me into some of my known migraine triggers recently. He would make me certain kinds of food and a lot of caffeine that often end up as a terrible migraine to me. He asks me about my menstruation period. He even disturbed my sleep with strong flashlight twice last week, one of which did trigger a migraine attack.

What's more, he even wants me to pretend having a migraine even I don't really had an attack.

After these successful ""attempts"", he would become much more attentive and requests sex to relieve my pain.

I don't know if he really cares about me or he just wants to trigger my migraine to fulfill his fetish.

438,Days with and without Migraine,"Days without migraines are a blessing. Time seems to be running slower and you feel more productive. You start caring about the relations and yourself. There is a positive vibe in your life and you can feel the positivity getting in when you inhale during the breath. At those moments, the sky is the limit. You feel so powerful that nothing seems impossible. 

Days with a migraine, on the other hand, is a curse. You can not focus on a single thing. Life becomes miserable. You become oblivion of your surroundings even if you know everything. It affects every aspect of your life. especially relationships. in office, you don't show interests and concerns what your colleagues are doing. while talking to them, you can barely smile and this cause the problems you can't recover from when the migraines are gone. It doesn't mean you can't do anything during the period of that excruciation pain. You could do anything you want, but do you want to do anything? Never. Thanks to the apathy created by the pain.

I had my suspicions of what this was before I had the MRI, but that pretty much confirmed it. I’ve been on Effexor (currently trying desvenlafaxine), B2, and magnesium since. The Effexor etc helps the most I think but even then sometimes I still have bad periods of days to weeks. 

I am pretty sure motion and lighting are triggers for me, which is really unfortunate. Walking around my office sucks, I’m constantly hugging the wall or just trying not to walk anywhere.

460,Thank you /r/migraine,"I really love this community and just wanted to say thank you. You guys put up with my seemingly extremely frequent vents and understand what it’s like to be in pain and not be understood in most other places. 

I don’t know how people went on for as long as they did in chronic pain before support groups online were a thing. It really does help with the mental aspects of everything. 

No one in my life in person knows what it’s like to be living in constant pain. Sure. I know people who have other chronic pain issues but everyone else’s is managed. And when I complain it’s seems to be invalid for some people. Getting either “why didn’t you take your medicine this morning?” Or “you’re always sick. You can’t always be sick” or they will suggest I take Tylenol. Or drink a cup of coffee. Or whatever. No Tylenol doesn’t help the pain. Coffee doesn’t help it but doesn’t hurt it (and I do love coffee so I probably get the coffee anyways 😂😂) but it seems never ending the amount of people who tell me I should be able to function normally. 


If you told me this three years ago before the constant pain started. I’d have never believed you that I’d be in constant pain for nearly two years (with no end in sight) I’ve suffered migraines as long as I can remember and was only hospitalized for one. I was five? And woke up from sleeping in my grandmas bed. I was screaming my head off cause of the pain. I have very few memories of that. But I remember the pain. I remember as a child constantly complaining of headaches. Then as a teen it developed to where I’d have 4/5 a month each lasting about 2-3 days. Plus a lot of what I believe to be “silent migraines” no one would treat me I begged my primary care doctor to help me. Often leaving the doctor in tears because of the pain and them refusing to help. Looking back my grandparents (they had custody) should have put their foot down and stood up for me but I guess looking back you can see the errors vs being in the moment. 

I didn’t even seek treatment until I had a 3 week one. I could deal with the short migraines. I mean it wasn’t fun but I was so tired of begging for help I just stopped trying. I had a 5 day long one in July of 2016. 
Then a 9 day long one in September of that year. That was when we officially ruled out that my cause was wisdom teeth related. It’s also when I found out that opioids don’t work on my head pain.  

It’s been a long painful journey. And still no light at the end of the tunnel yet. I hope one day I can function like a regular person in society again. But for now I’ll take the good and minimal pain days and cherish them.

I had a problem tooth, a back molar that was constantly needing new fillings. Last time I was there they told me I still had a large dark spot on my x-ray, and I should take special care of that tooth.

Last week I went to a new dentist and found out that my tooth was rotting from the inside and the nerve was retreating. I needed a root canal. They probably should have done something about that tooth way back then, because a ""large dark spot"" on a dental x-ray isn't a good thing. Today I got a partial root canal, 2 roots removed; part 2 is next week. Sure, it hurt a while afterwards, but I took some regular ol' acetaminophen and I felt so good that it was like I was high. I still feel high from this physical cool relief. I haven't felt this comfortable in years. I can't wait to get the rest of the roots removed. I didn't realize I was in this much pain from one tooth, or that the tooth was decaying at all. But interestingly my migraines and tension headaches were increasing steadily over those 2+ years and all I felt in the way of toothaches was just a little uncomfortable once in a while.

I’ve been suffering from migraine with aura since 2011. I didn’t get them often, but when I did they pretty much ruined my whole day. After getting them for a few years, I finally was checked out by a neurologist and was given prescription medicine and told to stop taking combination hormonal birth control immediately. 

After trying a few different triptans, I found a pill I could tolerate (Relpax). I also tried a few types of birth control that I was allowed to take, and am finally happy with a copper iud. I also started going to therapy and have learned to cope with the fear I had about getting migraines and ruining plans, trips, exams, etc. because of them. 

It’s been over a year since I have had a full blown migraine with aura, and I just had an MRI of my brain that came back completely normal. I am feeling so hopeful that I have finally figured out my migraines. I still get the occasional headache, but nothing like I used to. I take my Relpax with me everywhere, but usually can get by with ibuprofen for my headaches now a days. 

It has been a long process full of ups and downs, multiple doctors, anxiety, and fear but this is the first time in a long time I feel in control. For anyone out there struggling I hope you can also one day find the relief I did!

471,"My ""Sinus Headaches"" Were Migraines","Hi everyone - 

I thought I'd share my story to help any other stubborn folks who may be experiencing what I have gone through.

So - I've known for years I get migraines but i thought I just got them a few times a year. Not frequently enough to treat with continued medicine or botox or anything like that. What I THOUGHT I got a lot of was sinus headaches.

I also KNEW that people frequently confuse migraines and sinus headaches. But, I thought, not me. Because I actually have migraines. So I know the difference. These aren't migraines. These are sinus headaches.

So i got allergy tested. Results said I had absolutely no seasonal allergies. Complained to the allergist that my sinus pressure was insane so he did an Xray. Normal. Sent me to an ENT.

ENT did a CT Scan of my sinuses to check for inflammation or tumors or abnormalities. I have so much sinus pressure I was expecting a giant tumor to be growing on the left side of my face pushing on my sinus cavity. Said my sinuses looked perfect and that if everyone had my sinuses he would be out of business. I almost didn't believe him.

Went to a neurologist. She was really awesome. I described all my symptoms to her. She said ""Is there anything else you want me to know about your headaches?"" And I said ""Yes. I am convinced there is something wrong with my sinuses. I'm wondering if I need a second opinion from a different ENT. Even right now I feel sinus pressure. and when I take a decongestant or use nose spray I'll start to feel better, so how could it not be sinus related?""

She told me this is textbook confusing sinus headaches for migraines. I felt like an idiot because I've read all over the place that people do this but I still thought ""Not me!!"". I learned today that not every migraine has aura like I'm used to and that basically every migraine I get isn't the same and has varying levels of pain, but the fact that I'm getting a headache bad enough to take advil or excedrin every single day means I'm suffering from migraines. She told me stop taking claritin-D, excedrin, drinking caffeine, using nose spray, and gave me a preventive pill. I'm so glad I went to see her.  Don't be stupid like me, don't discount your migraines as ""sinus headaches""!",,1,1
472,How the hell am I supposed to function?,"I had finally decided to stop ""sucking it up"" and go to the doctor for help a few months ago. My problem is that when I go to the appointment, the doctor essentially tells me that i should try getting more sleep or taking some Ibuprofen and seem skeptical about the pain and nausea levels. This is the same doctor who has been trying to help me find a sleep med that doesn't leave me groggy and unable to function the next day and also freaked out a bit when he found out the level of nsaids i take to deal with daily joint pain and headaches. I need help as the migraines are bad enough i am almost unable to move without dizzyness and severe pain. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Is there a non-opiod that will help? (i think his hesitation stems from a big drug abuse issue where i live and as a veteran i am apparently prone to developing an issue) Before anyone asks; tried going to the VA and since i had no official incident while in, they are little help to me.",,1,1
473,Trouble recognizing faces after aura,Today at work I started to get aura which usually means a migraine is 20 minutes away. I have some Sumatriptan at work so I took that so i didn’t have to go home. After about 20 minutes the aura went away but I still felt like I was in a deep fog. I work at a little cafe and we get a lot of usuals. After the aura left I had trouble recognizing faces of two regulars. They kind of looked familiar but I couldn’t tell for sure until they spoke and I recognized their voice. Just wondering if anyone else has had this happen before,,1,1
474,Numbness that persists after migraine,"Hi there. This is my first post. I've had migraines since I hit puberty, but they've increased in frequency over the years (I'm 34 now). I always have migraine with aura, and during my last pregnancy I had a very scary migraine where I could not write (I'm a copywriter for work so it was really obvious that I was mixing up words). I thought it was a stroke but the ER just said it was a migraine, which often worsen in pregnancy. I've always experienced some degree of numbness with my migraines, usually in my face or hands, but it generally goes away.   


I had a migraine with aura about 10 days ago and the numbness (not complete numbness, more of a tingling/decreased sensation feeling) is still there. It ebbs and flows. It's in my face, fingers, a part of my leg and I \*think\* in my throat. I still have a bit of a headache. Is this one continuous migraine? Has anyone experienced this? I went to a walk-in clinic and they said migraine and told me to follow up with my primary physician, who I am seeing next week. But I'm in Canada and the wait to see a neurologist will be months. The anxiety is killing me. I have convinced myself I have permanent damage or MS or something. I had one episode of numbness for an entire summer back when I was 20. I was under a great deal of stress at the time. I had an MRI and it was normal. Eventually the numbness passed. ",,1,1

There's road works going on outside my office building the past few days and they're drilling in to the concrete non stop for the entire day.

Advice would be great but mostly just need to vent to people who can understand!",,1,1
482,"Out of frustration, I wrote some ""Manufacturer's instructions for opening triptans."" Enjoy","We at Generic Pharmaceuticals realize that performing certain tasks, such as removing a pill from its packaging, can be difficult in the midst of a migraine or a migraine aura. For this reason, we have made opening triptans as difficult as humanly possible. Each pill is wholly sealed inside a plastic prison that, under any other circumstance, would require a small team of specialists to open. We hope that the following procedures will add some spice to your otherwise dull and uneventful existence.

**Instructions for Opening**

First, you must locate the medication in its proper packaging. If your triptan of choice is in a bottle, you must first open the child-resistant cap, which will not work. However, if you yell or shed tears in frustration, the cap will mysteriously come off, despite you trying to open it that way several times already.

If your triptan of choice does not come in a bottle, it most likely comes inside a little, plain-looking box. This box can be confused for ordinary things such as children's tylenol, toothpaste, or any number of other home health products. It can be surprisingly hard to find, especially during a migraine, but it is a very nice box. Inside the box, we have included little information pamphlets regarding your medication in fine print, specially designed to cause migraines in our more sensitive customers.

Now that you have removed the actual medication from its primary packaging, it is time to start extricating the individual pill. We have packaged the pills together in a perforated blister pack for maximum inconvenience, and you must tear the pill you desire away from this pack. Rest assured, we have worked closely with the product manufacturer to ensure that the perforated edges do not tear properly even once. You may either tear the edge, watch it tear into another pill, and be forced to use that pill instead; or you may locate a pair of scissors, which is a particularly stimulating endeavor after having to locate the little white box.

With the individual pill free of the blister pack, you must now peel off the paper backing. Some of you more astute readers may have intuited that this, like the other steps in the process, is designed to go poorly. The paper back will generally tear away in an incomplete fashion, requiring you to either gingerly scrape it away with your fingernail, or give up and leave it on the foil. (Please bear in mind that no paper backing can remain on the foil if you want the next step to work.) We have included a little arrow in the corner to show where to begin peeling the paper backing, and while this arrow serves no functional purpose, we feel it adds to the pleasing asthetic of the medication.

We have saved the best part for last. Now that the paper backing is inadequately clawed away, you must *gently push the pill through the foil.* This action requires a firm, steady grip like an athelete, but also the precise and gentle touch of a surgeon-- precisely the kind of nuanced fine motor control that is absolutely lacking in the midst of a migraine. You will see that there are instructions to avoid breaking or crushing the pill, which will happen immediately. Worry not. You may still imbibe the medication in its broken form. The warning was included only to add a sense of anxiety to the debilitating mood changes that already occur with your disorder.

Finally, now that you are holding the broken remains of your medication almost ten minutes after beginning to the extrication process, you may take it as prescribed. Since it has taken so long just to free the medication, it will not work. Quite by coincidence, we also manufacture a number of rescue medications that may be taken in the event of such an occurrence. 

Congratulations! You have taken your triptan. What a journey. In closing, we hope you appreciate the difficult and convaluted process we designed to obtain this medication, and we hope you join us again in a week for your next migraine. Thank you for choosing Generic Pharmaceuticals.",,1,1

488,"Made some serious progress, wanted to share my story, hope it helps!","I know the sidebar prohibits giving medical advice, so I'm not going to tell anyone what they should do. But I did make some fairly serious progress recently, and I thought you guys might be interested in what happened.

Some background: Fairly generic. I started having migraines when I was 16; I'm 22 now and have had about 30-40 since. Ocular migraines, fairly significant vision loss about 40 minutes before the migraine hits. Every migraine is triggered by aerobic exercise, although most of the time I exercise I am fine. First 15 migraines or so I had the standard please-kill-me headache accompanied with bad nausea but no vomiting. Eventually I gave into the nausea, stuck my fingers down my throat and just vomited, and frankly that eased the pain significantly and I have been doing it ever since. Migraine would end whenever my stomach was completely empty. But that's not for everyone, and it's not the moral of the story. Medication wasn't helpful, and I rarely digested it because well, vomit.

Last fall I had my aura after an intramural kickball semifinal. We won the semifinal, the final was later that night, and I decided to go even after I had my aura because the stakes were too high and frankly what did I have to lose? Nothing has ever made my migraines worse than they already were. And the funny thing is, while playing in the final, I had the least severe migraine I had ever had to that point. It wasn't enjoyable by any means, but at no point did I wish I was dead, which was pretty big progress for me.

Fast forward to June (with two terrible migraines in between), I get the aura after playing basketball and I'm in that stage where I'm panicking and asking myself ""what can I do to make the next three hours less terrible?"" And I thought back to that kickball game and said ""...exercise?"" Nothing heavy, just some light squatting and a sit-ups, all well spaced. And it worked! No vomit, and just a mild headache for three hours.

Fast forward to today, I play basketball, I get aura, I do some light exercise, and the aura was over about 75 minutes ago and I'm typing this with a mild headache and minimal nausea.

I'm not going to guess what's going on here, but I hope you find this helpful!

edit: ok I vomited a bit but this is still less miserable than usual",,1,1
489,"I get an upset stomach when having a migraine, aside from nausea. Anyone else?","When I’m having a migraine or when one is coming, I sometimes get a really upset stomach. I know nausea is very common (and I get that as well) but this is separate from that. Sometimes it will just be a churning sensation, sometimes I’ll have diarrhea. Does anyone else experience this?",,1,1
490,This sucks,"I’m sitting at work in front of my desk trying to will myself to work. I know I have a lot to get done, and I’m running out of time to do it. I concentrate on my work for 5 minutes, then jump to another task which leads me to another website, email, thing I need to do. I pop my neck, try to stretch my aching muscles. Take a sip of the Mt. Dew on my desk. Adjust myself in my chair. I consider going home, but I have a lot to do, and if I go home, all I will do is crawl in bed and watch Gilmour Girls. My need for self care battles with my need to keep my job and my drive to do well. 

People say migraines throb. Mine don’t throb. My migraines wrap around my head and squeeze like a python deflating someone’s lungs. My head feels like a tired muscle that can’t release the four-year long cramp it’s had. 

If I make it to Saturday, I’ll rest. Of course I will make it to Saturday. Migraines aren’t terminal. They aren’t going to degenerate my body to the point that it will lose function. I roll my head around to stretch my neck muscles. 

I’m tired. Physically I’m tired from the muscle aching and whatever processes are going on in my body that try to alleviate and compensate for the pain. I’m mentally tired of jumping from topic to topic and idea to idea. I’m emotionally tired. Tired of trying to think of treatments and home remedies to try. Tired of struggling through every day with something that will. Never. Get. Better. 

I’m tired of sucking on peppermints to deal with the nausea so that I can make it through another meeting. I’m tired of wearing a mask that is almost as permanent as my headache because every time I talk to someone about how I feel, their response is never good enough and it isn’t their fault. It’s like trying to sympathize with an alien. They have never felt this, will probably never feel this, and have never felt anything like this, anything this long term. So any sympathy is abstract and vague. I don’t even know what I need to hear. Nothing they say, nothing I say, nothing anyone says is going to make this go away or make it any better. Ever. ",,1,1

494,I think I figured what triggers my migraine,"So I've been suffering from migraines for most of my life. But most recently, the migraines have been getting very frequent and intense, lasting up to almost two days.

I began noticing that I have different triggers for migraines. The main one is this chemical called Tyramine. This chemical is found in a lot of foods, but mostly:

\*Avocados

\*Bananas

\*Beer

\*Soy sauce

\*Citric fruits (lemmons, oranges, pineapples, raspberries)  


  
Once I began avoiding these foods, I notices the migraines were less common.

However, I was still getting occasional migraines, and I noticed most of them were triggered in the middle of the night. At first I thought there was something I was eating or doing before going to bed. But I quickly began to realize it had nothing to do with what I ate. So I concluded it had to do with something else I was doing while sleeping.

Then it hit me: the position I sleep in

As of a few years ago I began developing the habit of sleeping on my back, for reasons I won't bother going into detail here. So then I thought: Maybe when I sleep on my back, I'm turning my head to the sides and that could lead to some kind of neck tension which could trigger a migraine. However, if I sleep on my side, the head stays in one position, as it lays on its side on the pillow.

And so I began sleeping on my side again.

The result is, the morning migraines have not yet happened. I say ""yet"" because I began trying this recently (about a month and a half ago)

I know different people have different bodies, and thus, different triggers for their migraines, but I thought sharing this might be helpful for some.

I'm still looking for a migraine free life and have been self experimenting with approx 30 substances now.

Decided I had to leave work because it takes me 40 minutes to drive home. As I got in my car the nausea intensified and once I got on the freeway, I was on the verge of vomiting. Can't say I felt that way before. As weird as this sounds, does anyone have ever experienced severe nausea while driving? Any tips?

They happen so rarely that when they start, I get spooked, and then when I realize what’s going on, the fear gets replaced with annoyance and slight amusement.  I have only ever had a painful migraine about twice in my life—both without the auras, but the painless aural migraines seem to be the thing my head prefers.  

What’s hard though is being at work and telling someone that you’ve gone temporarily blind and have to take a break, it feels like they don’t believe you.  Three of my four aurals happened at work and I always get the same response, that raised eyebrow, that concerned falseness that I’m not writhing in pain, but rather bumping into things and turning my head so I can get a clear spot to see what I’m doing.  And then trying to explain it and getting the “You sure you’re not tripping on something?” Jokes in return that further makes you feel like you’re not believed.  Anyone else share this experience?

516,Exercise outdoors seems to be not worth it,"I’m not really sure where else to put this that people would understand. I have put this type of post in weight loss or exercise forums in the past but often they just can’t understand.

I have no trouble losing weight via diet. Fortunately or unfortunately for me, often times I just feel nauseated and don’t want to eat.  The issue comes from exercise. Most exercise I enjoy requires being outdoors and I have found being outside in sun and/or heat makes me incredibly ill. 

I can lose weight and maintain from eating less, but I end up losing muscle mass and feel very weak. Right now I am at a healthy weight actually, but I would like to be toned. I suppose I can work out indoors but indoor exercise is repetitive and a chore for me. I love swimming and feeling the sun on my skin! I feel like a vampire cooped up inside. The lack of being outdoors makes me feel so depressed sometimes.

I have been house sitting at my aunts and she has a pool. So 2 days ago I stayed outside and swam for about an hour or two. I stayed hydrated the whole time sipping water. I applied and kept reapplying sunscreen and didn’t get burnt, and I wore sunglasses. But I still ended up with a massive migraine that night. The next day I still had residual headache but the vomiting and nausea wasn’t so bad so I went swimming for half an hour still keeping same precautions of hydration, sunscreen, and sunglasses, but I ended up even more sick that night to the point my migraine was one of the worst I’ve ever had and I almost went to the hospital.

Basically every time I am outside I end up ill that night, whether it be going for a walk, hiking, or swimming.

I usually do exercise a bit indoors most everyday. But I miss being outside I can’t find a strategy to avoid being sick from being outside. I suppose this post is mostly a rant but if anyone is in a similar situation and can provide advice please share. Thank you.",,1,1

I love hiking.  I used to do it all the time... Then my migraines turned chronic.  Increased heart rate is a big trigger for me.  

Yesterday, I went on a difficult hike.  Y'all, it was absolutely stunning!  I kept thinking, ""Why don't I do this anymore?""  Cue the migraine... ""Oh yeah!  THAT'S why...""  I thought I was going to die.  The trail kept leading up up and up the mountain.  With each heartbeat, I thought my brain was going to implode.  I was vomiting and trying to hold back the panic, but I still had 5 mountain miles to go...

Do any of you get what I call sneaky migraines? Where you're not sure if you've got a mild niggle in your brain that you might well be imagining, or if it's going to burst into a real migraine? 

I used to put off taking my Imigran (I think it's called Imitrex in the US - sumatriptan, anyway) because each pill is so precious, but now I've got more used to taking them at the first sign of trouble. I still miss the warning signs sometimes, though.

Another question I wanted to ask you is if you also take time off work when you have a non-killing migraine? I have a physical job, so I try not to feel as bad about taking time off, but sometimes I need to, even just for the mental aspect of dealing with a regular migraine. Am I being soft?

**Some extra info for the diligent migraineur:**

Midrin is distributed by Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, which is licensed by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries. Call this number to get more information: 800-818-4555.

The FDA keeps a database on drug shortages. I haven't seen Midrin  added to the database, but it doesn't hurt to check it out. [Here's the link](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/default.cfm). Keep in mind that Midrin is also referred to as isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone, acetaminophen.

532,First post -- my topamax side effects have changed/gotten worse?,"Hi everyone,

I'm really glad I found this community!! I'm a 28yo female and I was diagnosed with chronic migraine in May of this year. I started Topamax and since I went up to 100mg I've gone from having 6 migraines a week to about 2-3, and sometimes I go an entire week without one, which is, like, incredible. I'm still at chronic levels because of my episodic headaches but going for an SPG block next week to hopefully help supplement my meds.

I've had the usual Topamax side effects: tingly feet and hands, shitty word recall, and loss of appetite. But all of a sudden my loss of appetite has gotten WAY worse. I've been at my therapeutic dose of Topamax since late June, and I noticed I didn't have much of an appetite, but in the last few weeks it's like I can't eat at all. This morning it took me an hour to finish a bowl of cereal. The weird part is that I do feel hungry, but trying to eat is a challenge--it's like my body doesn't want the food. I've been trying to supplement by drinking juices and smoothies, but skipping meals is a migraine trigger for me, so this is turning into a bit of a vicious cycle.

My neurologist is wonderful, but I'm honestly terrified to tell her about this because I don't want to go off Topamax. Has anyone else had their side effects suddenly ramp up like this a month after already being on their therapeutic dose? Should I expect this to taper off? And is there something else I can do help ease myself into getting more nutrients so I'm not accidentally starving myself?",,1,1
533,Efficacy of abortives indicator of preventative success?,"Hi everyone. I was just wondering whether anyone has noticed or is aware of any ability to predict the likely effectiveness of a preventative drug based on success of abortive drugs?

I generally have a reliable and consistent response to sumatriptan and I'm wondering, for example, whether there's anything to suggest that sumatriptan sensitivity would indicate some specific preventative over others?

Being completely honest, I'm sort of wondering whether my high success rate with sumatriptan might be a good indicator for success in using Aimovig! I've heard some people refer to triptans having an impact on CGGP, and thus, if this was the case, my logic would lead me to believe that those who respond well to triptans may be more likely to see benefits with Aimovig.

Probably wishful thinking! But would be interested to know of any patterns like this that people have noticed",,1,1

535,"Cluster Headache or ""Regular"" Migraine?","So as the title suggests I'm not sure if I'm dealing with cluster headaches or the more common type of migraine.  I've been to a neurologist and will be going back.  As I'm sure all of you know migraine treatment is such a trial and error thing, and I'm really looking for some relief.  So in the meantime before my appointment I was wondering if anyone else has been through the same thing and can give any insight as to what they found and what worked that I can take as suggestions.

I experience all of the common symptoms of [**cluster headaches**](https://migraine.com/headache-types/cluster-headaches/).  The most notable being that my left eye starts going pink a few hours before an episode (which is my first warning sign that one is coming on) and eventually becomes full on bloodshot.  ([**Pic of me right now.**](https://imgur.com/a/U30Kr4k))  I was originally diagnosed with ""probably"" having cluster headaches.

I *also* experience the common symptoms of [**migraine without aura**](https://migraine.com/migraine-types/migraine-without-aura/).  However, once I was diagnosed I was prescribed topiramate (Topamax).  The pain was reduced from a 9-10 down to about a 2-3 most days, I only occasionally experience nausea, and the photophobia and phonophobia are gone completely.  My GP tried weaning me off (for some reason) and all symptoms came back with a vengeance.

The confusion comes in when the neurologist and all other medical resources say things like, ""Migraines typically occur with nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound. Cluster headaches are identified by groups of intense head pain, but don’t usually cause the other bodily symptoms.""

I understand the concept of ""typical"" and ""usually"" means that I could just be an atypical or unusual (aka highly unlucky) cluster headache sufferer.  I have an episode sometimes daily usually every 2-3 days.  So is it chronic migraine, with ocular symptoms?  Or extra crappy cluster headaches?  Ideas/suggestions?",,1,1
536,Can someone tell me a bit about SSDI and migraines?,"I have been getting botox for migraine for about a year now, am on preventative medication, take two types of abortive medicines, and am about to start aimovig injections either this or next week. I have failed most of the other preventative medications, and my migraine type means I CANNOT take triptans. I am really, really hoping this helps me, because my migraines have steadily been getting worse. After my botox, it seems that I can work for about a month or a month and a half before I have to leave again because of my migraine, which makes it too dangerous for me to even drive 10 minutes to work. I work part time, don’t get benefits, can’t move out, and can’t really afford to buy my own insurance- my parents have to help me pay for my medical bills etc. My job is super understanding about letting me leave for a month or so at a time so I can come back. I used to be pretty high up at my job, but had to demote myself and took a massive pay and hour cut- I went from making around 2500 a month to around 400-600 a month- and that’s if I’m able to work. 


AFAIK, I cannot qualify for SSI because I have too much money saved up, but am trying to use that to pay off my car.


As I understand it, I may be able to qualify for SSDI, and possibly work a very limited schedule, provided I don’t make more than $1100 a month- is that right? Generally I work a maximum of around 20 hours a week, but during the perios before my shots and after I can miss about a month and a half to two months of work, which is not good- I have no hope of moving on or doing anything at all with my life if I can’t even work for more than a fraction of the year..
.

I have had migraines since 2014- it was around early 2016 that they became so severe that I began to miss more and more work.

538,Just looking for some support,"Hi everyone,

This is the first time I've posted here - apologies that it's looking for sympathy!

I have hemiplegic migraine, really bad, triggered off by head injuries. After years of trying various treatments I was given the go-ahead for botox, which looked like it was going to help hugely.

However, the round I had in March led to a ten-day episode, and the latest lot in July triggered a huge thing (probably not helped by the unrelenting heat). Since then I've had this cycling aura that has led to me not being able to work for the last two weeks.

I saw a GP last Wednesday who said if it was still going today to possibly go to A&amp;E. I wanted to speak to someone about it first so I was going in on a referral and not just rocking up, and the surgery said they couldn't get me in because they're so busy today. I pushed and pushed and they've basically just created an appointment for me.

I've got the weirdest symptoms I've ever had and I'm losing perspective on things - I know it's migraine, and that it's migraine trying to get around being blocked by botox, I'm just shattered and keep thinking I'll end up unable to work or live or whatever. I'm praying my notes are read properly so I don't have to explain too much!

I’ve been having 6-10 painful headaches a month, and maybe some silent headaches thrown in there too. Some will last a few hours, some will last 4-5 days. I have a mix of tension headaches and some that turn into migraines. The most recent one I’ve had gave me visual disturbances and severe depression.

I’m on 50mg Topiramate right now (25am/25pm), 200mg is CoQ10, 200-400mg magnesium citrate, 2000IU Vitamin D3, 10 mg melatonin, and take methocarbamol for a muscle relaxer as needed at night. I also use diclofenac for an abortive but that has stopped working all day like it used to. Naproxen now when that wears off. I don’t think the supplements are working for me and I’m not sure what else is next. 

I got an MRI that came back clean. I don’t have an official diagnosis of a specific type of headache (still seeing a regular GP - not a specialist) I’ve tried chiropractic, which included some tens unit therapy on my upper back - that didn’t decrease frequency of my headaches, I’m already gluten free for other reasons and I don’t drink much alcohol due to taking the topiramate. 

I think the Topiramate is causing me to be really dizzy on top of just not working to prevent the headaches. I’m also getting numbness and tingling in my fingers and feet. The thing that’s really killing me are the depressive episode I’ve been getting after or during my headaches - those have been getting worse when I’ve been having my period also. 

What advice do you have for me while I wait for an appointment? How do you fight through the depression and exhaustion? I feel like all of my senses are dulled and I’m swimming through tar - even when I don’t have a headache. 

I’m working on getting some regular exercise right now, but I’m not doing a good job of it.

I literally jogged the first 500m before having to slow to walking because my head was pounding and I felt like I needed to vomit. Now I’m not the fittest BUT running that distance is well within my capabilities. 
In the past I’ve had these migraines brought on by a game of badminton (not a heavy one either!) or a gym session where I’ve pushed myself anything beyond what I’d class as ‘very comfortable’. 

I really wanted to enjoy today’s run but ended up walking the rest of it (9km) and still throwing up and napping afterwards. I was well hydrated and nourished. The temperatures weren’t ridiculous. 

Does anyone else suffer from exercise induced migraines (I’m reluctant to call them headaches as aside from the yawning prodrome which I get with ‘regular’ migraines being absent, they’re identical)? If so, how do you live with them? A future of not really exercising seems so miserable, not to mention unhealthy. Hmmm. ",,1,1
551,Had ONE beer at lunch yesterday and paid dearly [RANT],"Went on a day road trip/outing with friends yesterday, we stopped for a late lunch at a local burger place that has a large variety of beers, ciders and ipa on tap. Everyone wanted to try something new so we all ordered a single beer to go with our burger. I had about 3/4 of my glass of a rosé cider and a glass of water. 

Cut to 3 hours later, we are almost home and I feel a tingle. I try to ignore it. I drank a Gatorade and a bottle of water in the car. Hoping to avoid any dehydration. As soon as they drop me off at home I jump in the shower to get the days grime off of me. And I start to really feel bad, all the migraine warning signs are there. I was just so tired so I laid down, planning to rest for a few minutes and then get my meds. Well I feel asleep for 2 hours and woke up to a full blown migraine. I proceeded to vomit, followed by dizziness, loss of vision, aura, pain level of a 8/9.  

Finally got meds in me and was able to fall asleep for the night. I slept for 12 hours (not counting my nap). 

Lesson learned I’m done drinking beers/ciders. What started as a fun day with friends ended with torture. ",14 years,1,1

555,Anyone been able to get meds for migraines while on psych meds?,"TL;DR: basically the title

I've been dealing with migraines since I was 13/14. I went to a neurologist around that time and he gave me no prescription for it, I assume because I was so young. 

I am now 21, still dealing with migraines and my general doctor pointed out that simply taking Excedrin or Advil whenever I get one isn't the best option. I mean duh, but I'm hesitant to see my neurologist again as I'm on some psych meds that could interact with whatever he could prescribe. New here, so I don't know what that would be.  But if you're on psych meds, you're familiar with hearing ""oh but this could interact with x"" or ""are you sure your symptoms (migraine in this case) aren't being caused by x""

Not trying to bash any doctors here, honestly they'd be bad at their job if they didn't consider those things. Just wondering if it's worth it even making an appt considering mixing psych meds with pain meds could be...understandably a thing to hesitate on.

556,It was suppose to be a good day :(,"I have been off work nearly 2 weeks cause I got sick with a bad case of the flu on my last day of a 4 day off straight stretch. I only worked 2 days the next week. So now I’m back today. It didn’t go horrible. But it was still pretty bad. 

I work at McDonald’s and mostly work service though I know most positions. They kept me on service. I was taking orders all day. Which is where I wanna be. 

But my migraine has been manifesting itself very bizarrely the past few days. And today has been the worst of them. I get the typical pain in my eyes. But now the only way I can describe the pain is like being hit in the brain with one of those freakin electric tennis rackets that are used to zap bugs. It’s only a few seconds but the pain is 9/10 and it can happen anywhere from every 10 seconds to a couple times a minute and it’s extremely distracting. 

Oh and I also have had a bladder the size of an acorn today. I took two swallows of water and had to pee. 

I’m almost home. I just have to wait another 30 or so mins and I can be in my bed. But it’s annoying and frustrating. I hope my migraine isn’t evolving. Nearly 2 years in and I don’t know how much longer I can take it.  ",,1,1

560,Migraine and Nausea,"My wife, F 32, has within the last year developed infrequent migraines. She had one really bad one but the rest have been pretty mild until now. A week ago she got an awful crying-hysterically-unbearable-pain migraine. The headache lasted two days or so but whenever she thought she was over it she would get these attacks of nausea. 

She tried to go to work a couple days but always had to leave after a few hours because of nausea. 

She went to her Family Doctor who gave her Tooamax, an antihistime of some kind and Phenergan (sp) for the nausea. 

Saturday she woke up feeling well, we went to lunch and then a farmers market. She started feeling a little bad at lunch and when we left the farmers market I had to take her home to get some Phenergan and lay down. After the Phenargan induced nap she was OK. 

Woke up this morning and went to church. She was feeling a little lightheaded and then had to run out feeling like she was going to vomit. I had to help her to the car she was so lightheaded and nauseous. 

The only thing I can figure out is she is very light sensitive. Yesterday and today were very bright days and there are bright fluorescent lights at our church. She’s OK here at the house where it’s not particularly bright. Once we leave it’s just a matter of time. 

If you have any advice about directions to pursue I’d love to hear it. Thank you in advance.  ",,1,1

After seeing the amazing news that Aimovig got approved the other day I of course am hoping to get my hands on it asap. Before the trip I was living in a city with a family doctor shortage and so I had to constantly keep going to different walk in clinics any time there was something I needed ie. a triptan prescription refill. I havent gone to a neuro since I was a kid despite having chronic migraines since an accident several years ago and I found out he retired after further research. So I don't really have a home base doctor to talk to about aimovig and i'm worried about how little is probably known about it. Does anyone know if they have launched their Canadian site yet? When I go online there official website says for US only.

I saw in another thread that someone talked to their doctor who said it wouldn't be available for another three months. Can anyone elaborate on what their doctor has said to them about it?? Any info about when it might be available in Canada or if health care is covering it etc would be helpful.

I was wondering, is there anything I should be thinking or doing at this point?  Anything I should expect? Anything I should read? I ask mainly because I don't want to go down a crazed research rabbit hole and bug myself out about something that's no big deal.

What a mistake. I had a threefold increase in my migraines this past month, after several consistent months. No other changes. 


My new bottle got here yesterday, so looking forward to restarting and hopefully going back to fewer. I know there isn’t substantial data supporting it as a supplement, but it seems to work for me. Glad my neurologist recommended it last fall.

I also developed neurological symptoms like balance problems, phono and photophobia, slurred speech, ataxia, aphasia, brain fog, fatigue, insomnia and numbness. These symptoms would come and go. I went through a painful 7-8 year work up for MS. Many neurologists did not take me seriously.

My 8th neurologist decided to look for thyroid antibodies. Mine were sky-high, both the one for thyroglobulin and the one for thyroperoxidase. She told me I might have something called Hashimoto's Encephalopathy.

After my diagnosis, I read through some of the medical literature (I became ill while in med school and was diagnosed after completing my degree) and read that they were looking into a possible connection between thyroid antibodies and migraines.

That side is kind of messed up anyway because I had pretty bad scoliosis and spinal fusion surgery, so that shoulder has always been higher up, has more 'meat' on it, tends to bother me more than the other side, etc. The pain isn't \*that\* bad (def. take this over a migraine), it's just super annoying and distracting.

I think I've been making it worse by massaging it and stretching constantly. My boyfriend insists that it's my bones I'm massaging, not muscle, and that's making the pain worse (to me it just feels like my muscles there are rock-hard). I've mostly been coping by constantly applying Biofreeze. I even wonder if  CBD oil is to blame because when I was on CBD oil before the betablockers, I had fewer large scale migraines, but more all around low-grade chronic migraine pain. Now I'm weaning off the CBD oil because I think the betablockers do a better job, and they're cheaper. Anyway, any ideas for what to do about this?

I get normal 'over the eye' migraines that feel deep, spread around my eye and over to my temple, as well as above my eye and eyebrow. Lately though I've been getting those plus another kind that feels right under the skin and under an eyebrow in the eye-socket area. When I push in there I feel a large bump (on both eyes) that's tender and if I push on it sometimes it gives me some relief and sometimes it feels almost like a trigger point where it hurts but also feels like it needs to be worked out. If you find your tear duct then go straight up but kind of in to the eye socket, that's where the spot is. At times the spot is barely there, and other times it feels pretty big. I've tried looking it up but haven't found much except that there's a nerve that lives somewhere in that area. 

I asked my Chiro and she just said it was a joint in the skull or something, which maybe it is, it just seems weird that I have some new migraines that seem to originate and sit in that area.

596,"Suddenly awful migraine, unable to read and understand people.","So I have had migraines before rather sparingly but this one took the cake. I went to the gym for about 15 minutes and while I was there I started seeing distortion in my vision. This happened to me once this winter but I thought it would pass on my way to work if I close my eyes and buy some meds when I get there.

Anyway, by the time I got to work I was an absolute mess, I had extreme nausea and could not remember what Tylonnel was when I went to try to buy something to help. I sat in a cafe for 2 hours before trying to make it home. I could not read signs and could not understand what my mom was saying. I could not find words I was looking for. My arms and legs kept going numb. I don't really get panic attacks, but I was convinced I was dying because I didn't know what was going on.

I finally got home and threw up and took a nap and felt somewhat better. My head still hurts a bit but I am so paranoid of this happening again. I sent incoherent messages to my job trying to say I was not feeling well. What could have caused this?",,1,1
597,Reposting from r/Vent - I don't know what to do,"I don't even know where to start. I've had a constant migraine since January 2009 and I've tried all sorts of drugs, random trials and, most recently, botox and DHE. I'm under the care of possibly one of the world's best migraine consultants, Professor Goadsby. It's been 4 weeks since I had the DHE treatment (IV drip 3x per day for 4 days) and my pain levels have been constantly at a 7 or 8/10 for the past three weeks. Usually my pain sits around a 5/10 with exacerbations which isn't nice but at least manageable.

I feel drained, I have a full time job, a very supportive boyfriend and family yet I just feel like I can't take it anymore. I have contacted my migraine nurse and she has said it should start to get better around now and my next botox treatment is next Friday. I just don't know how much longer I can last in this pain.

I feel like I should see a dr but my GP doesn't specialise in migraines and where I'm under a separate migraine clinic in London I feel like my doctor can't do anything anyway. During the day I smile and fake my way through working with the general public, in the evenings I am so short-tempered and emotional. I keep crying and I honestly don't want anything from this post other than to just type out my feelings.

Who knows, maybe another migraine sufferer might read this and give me hope but at the moment I'm just finding it really difficult to see any positives. Thank you for listening.

Edit: I should probably add that I've been told I have chronic daily migraine. I took two 40mg Eletriptan last night, woke up with a 5/10 which is my baseline which within 30 minutes has now crept back to a 7/10 unfortunately. ",,1,1
598,Please help...,"I'm sorry. This is really long and rambling because it is 4:30 am and I am running on no sleep.
My 7yr old daughter has been having migraines and I don't know how to help her! They are behind her right eyebrow and hurt to the point she is in tears and vomiting. Some background-

Tuesday - Her first one was at 2 am on Tuesday morning. When she is given medicine, she throws it up within 20 minutes. We suffered through it of alternating pain medicine, throwing up, pain medicine, etc and she finally fell asleep a couple hours later. We kept her home and she slept on and off all morning, ate lunch and dinner, had energy...she did complain about pain around noon and was given another dose of pain medicine, but didn't get sick that time and just fell asleep for a little.

Wednesday - Back up at 2am with eye pain and vomiting again. Took her to the ER (when I talked to her pcp Tuesday she told us to take her in if she had another episode). They gave her some nausea medicine, pain medicine, said it absolutely is migraines, and sent us home. The ER doctor sent notes to the pcp and recommended they give us referrals to an ENT, pediatric neurologist, and have a MRI. We got home about 5:30 am and she passed out. Took her to her grandma's from 7:30-1:30, was told she did great, didn't complain, just relaxed. She was taking a nap when I picked her up (only about 10min long) and when I got her in the car she complained about eye pain again. I gave her medicine and within 5 minutes she was heaving. Took her home, let her rest. She woke up from her nap with tons of energy again and are a very tiny dinner. Fell asleep around 7:30.

Thursday (right now) - woke up in pain at 3am. Gave her medicine, at 3:15 (delirious lack of sleep mommy took a few minutes to find where she put the medicine/medicine cup). It is now 4:30 and we are on the 4th time she has thrown up. She is sobbing from the pain, I tried giving a watered down half dose about 20 minutes ago and she threw that up too. So now she is crying in bed and I am crying on the couch and everyone is so tired we don't know what to do anymore!

She has an appointment with her pcp Friday at 5pm (the soonest we could get her in). We are trying so hard to function. My husband and I both work (he works 10hr days and has already taken a day off this week, I work 2 part time jobs back to back from 7:30-5 and have missed half of yesterday). We are trying our hardest to function and still take care of our son while helping our daughter feel even the smallest amount better and feel like we are failing. I think I've gone off track.

Please does anyone have any tips/tricks/ideas to help, even a little bit of help, until her appointment and getting her specialists? We are lost and nothing is helping.

Meds we have given her over the last 74hrs:
Children's cold medicine
Children's pain &amp; fever
24hr Allergy medicine (her nose is like a faucet)
Inhaler (she has a cough too)
Cough suppressant
Nausea medicine (the er gave her this one)
I think that is it...I don't know how to fix my little girl...",,1,1
599,Does anyone else get similar symptoms in the lead up to a migraine?,"Hey. I’ve never posted on reddit before so please be nice to me :) 

Wondering if anyone else experiences similar symptoms pre migraine? I tend to get these symptoms in the week leading up to a migraine. 

- VERY vivid dreams. And not necessarily scary, just so real that I wonder if it actually happened. 
-  Diarrhoea - of my tummy not being quite right 
- Sensitivity to smell - I feel the few days before a migraine, I’m much more sensitive to smells, and notice them a lot more. Bleach in toilets or someone’s lunch. 
- Feeling down - not able to listen or really focus very well and also having times of feeling depressed or down. 

My migraines also tend to happen around events - Gigs, holidays, nights out; I don’t know if this is something to do with leading up to or getting excited for something. I wonder if anyone else has noticed this?
 
Would be genuinely interested to know if you experience something similar. I haven’t managed to find much more than a “typical” list of symptoms, but these are ones I have noticed in myself. ",,1,1
600,Multiple auras in one day,"Today I got three aura episodes in less than 4 hours. Second one occured almost immediately after the first one, and the third one 2-3 hours later. Headache also worsened after each one.

605,Interesting triggers: iced/cold espresso and airline travel/propranolol. Anyone else?,"I have a loooong (25yr+) migraine history that I won't get into all the details of right now, but I've noticed a couple of interesting phenomena and wondering if anyone else experiences these:

The first is that while I can tolerate hot espresso drinks, iced espresso drinks elicit a guaranteed migraine.  What's weird is that even if I make the espresso drink myself at home this occurs, and what's even stranger if I make espresso and store the extra in the fridge, then heat it up the next day to make a hot espresso drink it will still elicit a migraine near 100% of the time.  Again, if I drink fresh hot espresso (that hasn't been stored cold or served with ice) this doesn't happen - seems like something about the composition changes with cold??

The second is how airline travel elicits a horrific migraine.  I realize changes in barometric pressure are issues for many migraine sufferers, but the time course and severity are what seem odd:  I get the migraine two days after travel (it's always on day two, not the day after), and it's \*horrific\* - comes on fast, the pain tends to start bilaterally symmetric then progress to unilateral (my standard migraine start unilateral), is refractory to all the usual treatment, severe photophobia/nausea/vomiting (which is rare for my standard migraine).  Takes \*hours\* to get on top of.  What's really weird is that propranolol use elicits a similar type of headache, which is a repeatable effect.  Something about modulating blood and/or intracranial pressure??  Multiple MRIs/MRAs/CTs haven't revealed any significant findings, fwiw.

Anyone else experience these effects?  Many thanks, and much love to all my fellow sufferers.  ",,1,1

607,Good non-triptan abortive?,"I currently have no abortive that I take. I'm not at chronic frequency thank goodness, but it's still far less than ideal to ride every migraine out (2-3 days).

I've tried every triptan except naratriptan. They either don't work or have bad side-effects.

Frovatriptan used to work and would not have side-effects, but both of those things are no longer the case.

Side-effects of any kind are almost intolerable for me because I can almost never tell when a migraine is going to start, so I can never catch it early. Or if I am suspicious that one may be coming on, I become filled with anxiety because I have to decide whether or not to take the meds.

I've also tried Ibuprofen, Excedrin migraine, and DHE nasal spray, all of which have no effect for me.

Is there anything else worth asking my neurologist about that does not have bad side-effects?",,1,1
608,How do I tell one is coming? How do I tell what my triggers are?,"Has anyone else who lacks any obvious auras figure out how to do this?

Sometimes I get very a subtle visual aura--a single point of light that appears for about half a second.  Rarely this may happen 2-3 times total in one day.  In each case a migraine might follow, or it might not (50/50?). Sometimes I don't even know if what I saw was an aura or some other light.

Sometimes I get irritable beforehand, but I have never been able to recognize a clear link to help me predict migraine onset.

Sometimes I get light-sensitive beforehand, but I think this is usually a symptom of a migraine that is already underway for me.

Maybe I get particular food cravings sometimes?

I have also never narrowed down any definitively concrete triggers, so I can't really use that information to help me predict either.  No foods are clearly linked to migraines for me.  Perhaps weather changes, but perhaps not--how do I even evaluate this idea?  Some forms of stress can trigger one for me, but other forms of really high and prolonged stress have no effect whatsoever, so I think it's more subtle than that. A very bright light can trigger one and I will know it immediately, but I generally am able to avoid that situation anyway.

How do people actually evaluate non-food triggers?  With food, I get that you can eliminate items from your diet and add them back in in a controlled way.  How do you evaluate other potential triggers that you have no control over?

Notably, my neurologist does not think that food triggers are worth trying to track down.",,1,1
609,Neurofeedback Evaluation,"I've been doing neurofeedback for my migraines for a few months now.

How would people suggest I go about evaluating its effectiveness?  I'm also curious how people evaluate the effectiveness of preventive treatments in general.

Right now I have a calendar on which I track every neurofeedback appointment and every migraine day (among a few other things).  Is there anything I should try other than ""see if there are less migraines.""

It's also difficult to be rigorous about it for me because I am doing a few other things for treatment now: chiropractic, craniosacral massage, and CBT.  I am not willing to experiment with cutting out any of those treatment options for a significant period of time.

So far, my sense is that maybe it helps?  I don't really know.  I had a couple good months there, and July was not so great and today I have my first migraine of August.  Then again, I had to reduce my neurfeedback session frequency for a little while there, so that is correlated with an increase in migraines.",,1,1

Obviously, these are not things I can keep on hand for myself, and he's pretty expensive to go to. Of my 4 tries with ketamine, two were IV and I went home eventually feeling better, but the two IM ketamine injections left me feeling worse.

'I am going to throw away this paper towel' and instead I put it in the medicine cabinet in my bathroom.

It wasn't the usual 'why did I walk in here?' kind of thing, where you forget why you walked into a room. It wasn't confused-feeling, like when you're drunk or high and just space out.

624,Fever with/after migraine?,"Hey everyone. I'm a longtime lurker of this sub and the amount of support I feel just reading through it is awesome. I have a question based on a migraine episode I'm just coming in the clear from.

Does anyone ever experience extreme fever symptoms accompanying a migraine, with fever onset mid-attack or postdrome? Not just a bit warm or a bit chilled, but full body chills and full body overheating/sweating?

Full background/details if you want to read more: I've been having migraines for the past 10 years or so, and about 3 years ago they drastically increased in frequency. Went through mris, mras, and ct scans and things looked normal. Currently only have sumatriptan, which intermittently seems to help. Up until recently, the migraines had been pretty formulaic, although a few lately have been a bit different. 

I had a mild migraine on Saturday morning that cleared fairly quickly and I was feeling relatively better by that night, with only a bit of postdrome residual headache, which is pretty normal for me. I went for a fairly long walk the next morning for some fresh air and felt good - no symptoms or headache, but when I got home, I started to feel headache symptoms coming back in the usual migraine spots, and then began to develop extreme body aches and muscle fatigue (which is atypical for me). I then started feeling extremely chilled, to the point of teeth chattering, which lasted a few hours, before it switched to heating up, feeling almost feverish. The head pain never increased much more - nowhere near normal migraine level, but when I was trying to go to bed, I experienced some of the worst chills I've ever had, leading to involuntary shivering in the fetal position, covered with every blanket i could find. Then in the middle of the night, the chills ended and I immediately began overheating - full fever with sweating over my entire body - which lasted until mid day the following day. After the fever seemed to break, I still had mild headache, fuzziness and inability to concentrate (my most frequent, typical postdrome symptoms), and they're just now clearing. 

So I'm wondering if the aches/chills/fever could possibly be a result of the migraine? I've never had those symptoms before, but the migraine the previous day, combined with typical (for me) postdrome symtoms after the fever make me wonder if it could be connected. I never experienced any other signs of any illness that would cause a fever, though it's definitely possible that the fever and the migraine just happened coincidentally. 

If you read all the way through that, thanks for reading! I needed a place to write it all down to help me process it a bit, and I'm curious if anyone else has had similar experiences. And a broad thanks for all the support this sub provides!",,1,1

my migraines are so strange (at least to me). i get numbness and tinglingness on one side of my face and might go down to my neck and throat and my pain is scattered or in one spot. right now the pain is behind my right ear and right by my eyebrow and cheek. last night i got a total of like 2 hours of sleep because of my migraine. i had to call out of work ( first time ever calling out). i don’t notice progress, instead the opposite. i noticed that i am beginning to slur my words at work when i have a migraine. i feel burning and pressure and sometimes the pain is so bad that i just want to SREAM because i can not take it anymore. i feel so helpless. 

so now im here. before find out about reddit i thought i was the only one suffering from this and i was super depressed. now that i’ve found this community of people i get some sort of relief that there are people like me and we can help each other feel better. so if anyone has similar symptoms like me and has found a magical cure or has any suggestions please let me know thank you!!!

633,Differentiating migraines from other types of headaches,"Probably a stupid question, but how do your headaches feel?

I have daily headaches that feel like a burning/stinging sensation across my temples and forehead, accompanied by neck pain sometimes. They get worse as the day goes on and get up to a 6 or 7, and at their worst, it hurts for my eyes to focus on things.

Once a month or so I have a definite migraine with throbbing, light sensitivity, etc.

My neurologist diagnosed me with ""new daily persistent headaches"" and migraines.

He recently prescribed me sumatriptan and aimovig to treat my daily headaches, but I am concerned because they both seem to be for migraines. 

On the box for sumatriptan, it says not to take for cluster headaches, but if I sit there and try to analyze my headache to determine if it's a migraine or not, I get nowhere and the pain just gets worse.

After a full neurological exam and talking for 30 minutes, she told me that not only could I increase my preventative by almost 100mg but also that the sumatriptan I was taking was a half dose, hence why it was taking longer and more pills to relieve me of the pain. 

I am feeling genuinely positive that I can move forward and somehow my migraine feel much more manageable as I have a plan. 

Don’t give up, push to see that neurologist if you can, if not, ask your PCP about dosages for medications you’re on. I had no idea that mine were low until today. ",,1,1
636,My migraines are changing. I need advice.,"Hi everyone, just discovered r/migraine. Sorry for any typos or misspellings in this post, I’m just coming off of a 5 day migraine.

Through puberty, I had constant migraines along with your average headaches in between. Early twenties, they evened out to one hormonal migraine with a few headaches mixed in throughout the month. All of that I felt “comfortable” with and could handle.

Cut to last year, around my 26th birthday. I started getting a few monster migraines throughout the month. So bad they’d wake me up in the middle of the night, projective vomiting, etc. I’m in a peculiar place with work and the constant fear over calling in sick made my diagnosed anxiety go into overdrive, but I wasn’t sleeping and at my wits end.

Now, my last two cycles have produced extremely epic migraines that have lasted up to five days straight. Last night, I ended up having a massive panic attack towards the end of my five day migraine. I was SO tired, my head hurt so badly, and I felt like I was ruining my husband’s birthday. Today I’m on the downswing, feel incredibly low, and have next to zero energy.

Have any of you experienced changes in your regular migraine pattern? I’m thinking of making a GP appointment today, but beyond that I feel a little helpless.

Thank you all!

641,Birth control: making migraines better or worse?,"Hi all! I have a question for you. I've been on hormonal contraceptives continuously since about mid-2006 (when I was 17.) First OrthoTricyclen-Lo, then Lybrel, then in 2007 I switched to Yaz, which I've been on ever since. Also in 2007, I started getting migraines (no aura.) These hit way worse during the sugar pill week, so my doctor and I decided that I would only do the sugar pills once every three months. I still get migraines for all sorts of reasons as well as seemingly randomly, and they land me in the ER at least once a year. I've also developed occasional problems with chronic daily headaches. My sister and father have had the same problems in the past.

Now all this time I assumed my birth control was helping me control my migraines by keeping my hormones steady and letting me skip periods. But I'm realizing that I only started experiencing migraines after beginning birth control. Both my mother and sister cannot take hormonal birth control due to side effects, but I've always assumed I didn't have this problem. But is it possible my migraines are actually linked to hormonal contraception? Anyone have any experience with this?

They’ve always been headaches accompanied with muscle spasms and tightness in my upper back, neck, and shoulders. I am currently on propranolol and Namenda and have had 2 Botox treatments so far. 

For the past month or so, my actual headaches have been a bit better however I’ve had TERRIBLE one sided chronic neck pain. It hurts to turn my head or neck and my muscles in my neck and traps are as hard as a rock. I have not had any injuries or trauma to the area during this time. 

Is it possible for a migraine to present itself simply as one sided neck pain instead with a full blown headache too? I am seeing a new neurologist this week so I am hoping for some answers. I have tried taking Tizanidine (muscle relaxer), icing it, and hot showers. ",,1,1

650,Anxiety or Migraine?,"I've been having migraines for the better part of 20 years now, and I still feel like I don't understand them at all.

 They began as something that happened every 6 months or so, presenting themselves first with auras -- usually ocular and sometimes coupled with aphasia (I would lose my ability to speak or comprehend).  Through time, there have been moments where they get more frequent, but I also have had large gaps of time (2 years in one case) without a migraine at all.   

Through the years I've identified potential triggers to only to start getting them again after eliminating the suspects.  I'm currently avoiding caffeine, sugar, and chocolate.

Since January they have become  more frequent and I find myself getting one every 2 months without fail.

I'm at the point where I'm always anxious that I'm about to experience a migraine, but more so the aura's that come with them.  Since they can be pretty debilitating (loss of vision or ability to communicate possibly), its a pretty huge source of stress in my life.

This morning I woke up after a very poor night's sleep feeling very confused and very anxious.  I felt as though I couldn't think, express my thoughts verbally, or even read text.  I woke my partner because I started getting extremely anxious.  From my view point, I was suffering from aphasia.. but for him, he could understand everything I was saying and everything looked more like a panic attack to him.   Eventually I took some Zomig (I didn't want to fall into a bad migraine if that is what was happening) and went back to sleep.  I woke up feeling way better, but just with a mild headache.

I'm left confused whether I experienced:

a) an anxiety attack that caused me to create this sense of aphasia in my own mind and also develop a headache from the stress 

or

b) a migraine with a mild form of aphasia that I dislodged using my medication  


I can't tell if I'm getting anxiety from migraines or if I'm now causing my migraines with the anxiety they cause me.

I'm always trying to judge if I'm having a visual disturbance or just maybe looked at a bright light, or if I'm suffering from aphasia or maybe I'm just having a moment of confusion.   This all seems useless considering when I'm ACTUALLY experiencing either of these, they hit full force and I have no doubt in my mind what I'm experiencing.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  Any words of wisdom?  It's like the daily worry and anxiety has gotten worse than the migraines themselves.",,1,1
651,Anybody else experience this type of migraine,"My migraines aren’t extremely painful, but the aura is almost constant. I suffer from visual snow and tinnitus, most likely from my migraines my neurologist tells me. Now like I said, they’re not super painful, mostly just really annoying, like a nuisance. However I get pain behind my eyes sometimes that feels pretty bad. The only concern is the visual snow and tinnitus. Most of the cases I’ve read here are people suffering from acute pain however I’m curious if anybody else is suffering from a unique case like mine.

652,Difficulty reading led to an interesting thought,"I've had a few ocular migraines this week. I usually just get aura symptoms but a few times a year I'll get a full-blown migraine, complete with hallucinations, loss of vision, aphasia, light/sound/smell/texture sensitivity, and vertigo. This time it decided to interrupt a trip to the coast, *thaaaaanks*. So I got to ride home two hours on very windy roads, with the sun blinking thru trees, *coooooooooooooool*. Thank god I don't get nausea or I would have just jumped out of the car into a ravine.

Anyway. I'm in postdrome now (*hopefully* postdrome, and not prodrome to another one building), and reading is so super difficult. It's like the words are running away from my eyes! Then occasionally the words will sit still enough that I can read them, but their meaning doesn't actually get thru to me unless I **really** focus hard.

Is this what dyslexia feels like? I wonder how many kids diagnosed with learning disabilities actually have migraines, but have been misdiagnosed because people still think migraine=headache. Visual disturbances, memory holes, aphasia, attention deficit, etc etc etc, I can't help but wonder how different my education would have been if my ocular migraines had been diagnosed at 13 instead of 33.

This random thought was brought to you by sleep deprivation and postdrome mania, and took over 45 minutes to type.

653,How long do food triggers take to start your migraine?,"I have been trying to figure out if certain foods (particularly soy, dairy, and alcohol) trigger migraines.  I have tried an elimination diet and still got headaches from life in general, and am slowing reintroducing these into my life.  So for example, yesterday for lunch I had some tuna fish, which had both mayo (contains soy) with a little cheese on it.  Five hours later, I had a headache.  Now, while I can't nail down, if it was the soy or dairy, I am curious to hear other people's experiences on how long after they eat these trigger foods they get headaches.  Is it typically within an hour, a few hours, or does is there even a gap of 24 hours or more?

Edit: I'll update once the posts stop coming in, but right now, here is what is reported:

0-2 Hrs : 10

6-12 Hrs: 4

24 Hrs: 3

24-48 Hrs: 3

48+ Hrs: 1

My basic takeaway so far, is that most people have them within 2 hours, and or at least the same day.  With the minority still having an impact up to two days later, but seldom longer than that.  That's good info folks.",,1,1
654,Migraine? Cluster headache? I don't know what this is or what to do.,"I'm currently sobbing in my living room at 7am after a second straight night of barely getting any sleep because of this pain. It started about a month ago, but a doctor I work with thought maybe it was sinusitis since I was very congested at the time. She prescribed me some antibiotics that I took for ten days and it seemed to help me out. A couple weeks after the last pill, though, and I'm in agony again.

The pain is awful. It's frustrating. I can't sleep because it gets worse when I'm laying down. It's only focused on one side of my head, the right side, and I feel it in my sinuses as well. I feel it beside my nose, under my eye, and I also feel it in my teeth. My upper teeth are throbbing with pain. Sometimes my front teeth, but usually the back molars. I can't get comfortable. I can't sit still. 

I went to a walk-in clinic (my family doctor is closed for the weekend) and the doctor kind of shrugged me off and told me it was a sinus infection again but I am not congested at all. He gave me more antibiotics but I don't have a lot of faith in them helping because I don't think it's sinus related. 

Any tips to point me in the right direction until I can see my family doctor? What is this pain and how do I even BEGIN to manage it? I'm taking extra strength Advil every few hours but that doesn't seem to be making much of a dent in my discomfort.

I couldn't tell which was causing this awful constant cycle of headaches and migraines. I read an old thread of someone on here saying daily Mucinex nearly cured their migraines. I pmd her and she said a year later it was still working. Down from 20 migraines a month to 2 around her period. So I went to the store, got some Mucinex sinus Max, and that very afternoon started feeling better. That was Tuesday and today is Friday and I haven't had a single headache or migraine since that lasted longer than a half an hour. Just wanted to let people know!

Almost always after exercise, doctor thinks its possibly dehydration. I'm not so sure as I drink more water than anyone else at the gym and take 1.5 litres for a single basketball game/training. IMO its possibly not getting enough oxygen to the brain as no matter my conditioni mg I always go hard and gas out, and have breathing intake issues coupled with a red face after minor exercise.

Anyway first GP recommended 10mg maxalt(triptan) every 4 hours during a migraine and it helps very slightly. Honestly as your probably all aware the pain is extremely depressing so my routine is to try and take a maxalt and get to sleep when I get the consistent symptoms of blurred vision and tension headache.

It is made of mostly tobacco mixed with other herbs but there are ones without tobacco as well. This is normally blown inside the nostril and at first it gives you intense pain in such a way that you feel it moving through all your sinuses. You actually feel where all the sinuses reach inside your head. And after a couple of minutes and lots of nose blowing, you get very clear (which is the main purpose I guess). Once I did it while I had a strong headache and voila, it was almost completely gone. Then I bought myself a little and started to apply it when I have headaches and so far it is working great. But I know these sort of things build tolerance and I don't know if in the long run it will lose its effect. Anyone else here have experience with rapé and migraines? I'd appreciate it a lot. Thank you.

683,"25 y/o F, 5+ year intractable migraine, awaiting Aimovig","Hi all. New to this forum. Finally joining because I'm at my wits end for the hundredth time. I recently turned 25 and my ""migraine"" started in 2013, a few weeks before turning 20. I had serious traumas/PTSD coupled with MONO, was given horrible medications for other things that I never should've taken (genetic tests now show I can't tolerate those meds) plus I have EDS, which all came together to create a monster migraine that never, ever went away. Call it what you want- New Daily Persistent Headache, status migranosis, chronic intractable migraine, whatever. POTS symptoms also started at the same time, not sure which came first.

I moved home from University Dec. '13, thinking I was just overwhelmed with PTSD and taking a semester off would fix everything. I continued to worsen and gain symptoms for about 4 years, with some big improvements in NON headache symptoms over the past year, but no change in migraines (besides less hormonal (extra/worse) migraine). I went from being highly intelligent, independent, and ambitious, to living at home with my parents and unable to function AT ALL. I am severely depressed. I've been depressed lifelong, worsening as a teen, and it obviously continues to worsen since I can't function. The only thing that takes the edge off is Valium, which I hate taking. I am hypersensitive to meds (and born a highly sensitive person), and hate western medicine in general. But the only reason I've been able to be 10% more active/normal in the past year is because I take Valium every 2-5 days, which helps enough to get me out for a few hours or less.

My head hurts too much to continue but want to note. Saw Dr. David Dodick of Mayo AZ last month (I've seen every headache specialist under the sun and tried everything you can think of, including IVIG and bizarre eastern remedies), and he helped design the clinical trials for Aimovig. He assured me I have chronic migraine, even though I never thought of this as a migraine since it never ever stops for a second, and that Aimovig COULD be a success for me, given what great results he's seen, even with the most difficult patients. I am really upset that 5 weeks since my appt, I STILL haven't received a call from the pharmacy to schedule delivery. I got a letter this week from Aimovig saying they'd call ""soon.""

Will write updates when I start. In the mean time, any support appreciated, specifically miracle success stories for intractable patients, because I can't take this anymore. Thanks. -sid",,1,1
684,Question about Nitrites,"Hey y’all!

I have a sensitivity to sodium nitrite, it gives me migraine with aura at least one day after consuming any cured meats. I have found this out through process and elimination as well as family history and my own research into the role of nitrites and migraines. 

Because of this, I can no longer eat ham or bacon, or any other cured meat in the amounts that I used to consume them (I absolutely love pork, my heart is broken over this still.) 

Anyway, contrary to my username, I’m not a huge beef eater, but today I was craving a burger, so I went and got one. Well, usually the kind of burger I get is a turkey burger, but I guess they’ve since changed it to a beef patty, which I didn’t realize until I got home. So my question that a simple google search couldn’t exactly answer for me is:
Does ground beef have nitrites in it? 
 I’m trying to feed my odd greasy burger craving without facing the future repercussion of having a migraine.

Also, just to be clear, I am *not* talking about nitr**a**tes, I’m talking about nitr**i**tes. So far I haven’t found substantial evidence to conclude that nitrates give me a migraine, only nitrites.

685,Help with classification,"Hi all,

I have been diagnosed with chronic migraines but I feel like it doesn’t fit. I’m hoping to see if anyone can share any insight as to what I may have, as I think that would help with treatment.

I have stabbing pains in my forehead only, just above my eyebrow, every day. It’s always one sided at any one time, but can frequently change sides (multiple times a day even).

I don’t think it fits migraine because it’s not throbbing and not localized to one side. Sometimes I have nausea, but it is not very common.

689,would like some advice - chronic migraine/s.,"I've suffered with migraines on and off since I was about 12. However, I have had a migraine pretty much everyday for about 2/3 months now. I've been to the doctors three times - first he prescribed me migraleve (which doesn't help chronic due to codeine base), then sumatriptan which didn't help at ALL, and now Zolmitriptan. They're only 2.5mg and whilst they have slightly helped my symptoms, when reading the information book, it says not to take it for more than 10 days in a month? And to take no more than 2 doses in 24 hours. I'm not sure how this is going to help when my migraines are CHRONIC, and not just rare occasions.

I can't decide if the doctors think it's safe to take it more, or if they're really not listening to my issue here.

692,So done with GPs on a power trip who deem my hemiplegic migraines as not important enough to be referred to a neurologist,"This is a rant.

Was told six weeks ago that is finally be referred to a neurologist after sixteen years of on and off horrific migraines. I get the full works; blindness, inability to form sentences, weakness down one side, vacant episodes, the whole nine yards. They're not as often as they were when I was a kid, but still between 3 on an amazing month and a dozen on a really bad. And with the severity when they do hit, it's at least a day off work, probably more cuz they last forever. And as a university nursing student it's just not okay.

Phoned up today to ask when I'd likely hear something back about my appointment and was told the referral I was told would be made six weeks ago never was. Because a different doctor consulted, who I have never met, decided they weren't bad enough. That they were obviously just due to stress, ignoring the fact that I've been visiting frequently for almost two years since I can't handle them anymore and I've had them for 16 years!! Nope just because the last time I was in the middle of exam period, they must all be to do with stress. Jesus.

I have to now get an appointment with this genius doctor and try to persuade her to refer me. I swear if she suggests triptans I'm going to have a fit, since triptans are contraindicated in hemiplegic migraines which of course she wouldn't know because she isn't a neurologist.

693,Imitrex side effects,"Hello ya’ll!

Question: Does anyone else feel incredible pressure and an almost heated feeling on the back of the neck and behind your ears when taking Imitrex?

Background

I’m a lifelong sufferer of migraines with my symptoms manifesting initially as what some would call a severe ‘sinus headache’ before progressing to more traditional migraine hell.

Currently prescribed 25mg of Amitriptyline transitioning to 60mg of Propranolol for maintenance.  Previously I’ve been prescribed Topamax. I found the Topamax lead to serious memory issues and the Amitriptyline left me in a catatonic state, hyperbole barely.

I also maintain a 50 mg prescription of Imitrex for the random break through migraine. I find the occasional Advil Cold and Sinus relieves some of the pressure allowing me to focus of the pain and possible management.

Was wondering if sleep patterns and Migraines have ever been linked. 

I wake up pretty much at 3am, waking up into a fully fledged migraine, every night. Last night - first night i can remember, my son woke me up around 2am, he had heard a jet fighter go over at low level and he just had to tell me.

Thought nothing of it - went back to sleep - did not wake up at 3am suffering and woke up at 6:30 ish with a headache but by no means migraine level. Could sleep patterns be bringing on/triggering ?

701,Does anyone else get extremely frightening auras that are mostly non-visual?,"I'm currently in the middle of a migraine aura, and it's a bad one. The first time I had a migraine in about a decade was last year, the aura caused me to panic and go to the hospital. Since then I have been diagnosed with migraines, although in my case I almost never have visual aura; the closest I get is kind of the sensation of having stared into the sun with one eye, and even then it's rare.

Generally my auras are mostly body-sensory; I get a strange numb dissociative feeling, followed by my body's sense of position and place, and my depth perception gets a bit out of whack. It's extremely distressing; the first time it happened I thought I was having a stroke or seizure, or that something was really wrong with my brain.

Since then I have had an MRI which was clean, but my life has changed completely after that first attack. I spend most of my time worrying about when the next one will happen, so anxious and depressed that I'm seeing a psych and I'm on two medications because life is just miserable with this condition. Despite an MRI and multiple exams I feel so odd and crappy so much of the time that I sometimes feel like there's no way my brain is ok. I've tried multiple medications but the only thing that seems to work at all is taking three aspirin right when I get the aura; I get the headaches associated with migraine, but they're easy to deal with compared to the aura.

702,"Anyone else had ""the migraine talk"" with your boss?","Mixture of joking/serious... 

With every new job/supervisor, I have ""the migraine talk"" - meaning, I give them the heads up that I will sometimes call in late with a migraine.

Other times, nothing will work, the migraine will lead to nausea &amp; vomiting, and I'll be out of commission for the whole day. But, I am **Not Hungover**! Migraines are one of the main reasons I rarely ever have a drink or 2 - since a hangover is a guaranteed mega-migraine.

706,What migraines have done to me,"My story of job loss and its resulting anguish is probably similar to millions of other Canadians', but the experience came home to roost for me in all its painful and technicolour glory in the past three years, leading to life threatening depression and despair, and a financial and psychological devastation from which I am not sure I can ever fully recover.  Let me illustrate for you my excruciating descent from middle class comfort to working poor precariat.

In September 2015 I was ambling along comfortably in my routine of working for the local wealth management division in one of Canada's big banks, conveniently walking to work, working 8:30 to 5 pm in a beautiful office with my colleagues and friends of 24 years, and enjoying the fruits of my long years of service:  a feeling of competence and security, friendships, full benefits, four weeks vacation, ample sick days and understanding to accomodate my growing migraine problem.  I had done a good job over the years, earning my way to the top of my administrative income bracket, $53,000 a year. I was 44 years old, widowed, and had never been able to finish my university degree.  Truth be told, I was not exactly cut out to work with affluent high net worth individuals, coming from Hamilton's poor North End, and doing a lot of social service and social justice volunteer work on the side.  In my heart of hearts, I had always wanted to be a hairdresser and musician, but economic necessity made landing a local bank job in 1991 a very attractive option for me.  My work around solution for career satisfaction was to volunteer doing haircuts for street involved youth on the side, and play with as many bands as I could on evenings and weekends.

My normally affable manager abruptly pulled me into the boardroom quite unexpectedly on the morning of September 24th, and there I came face to face with a panel of HR representatives, and the air so crisp you could feel the chill.  My first thought was that I was finally going to be spoken to about taking almost all of my vacation days as sick days, since my migraine problem was becoming chronic and unpredictable.  I was then presented with a termination letter and severance package, and my manager left the room.  My eyes welled with tears, and so many thoughts raced in my mind:  now I can go to hairdressing college!  Who else will hire me with such a debilitating problem, for which disability coverage is not an option?  Oh my God!  What about benefits?  Each migraine pill cost $22 and I was using at least 10 a month. The job was certainly a stressor, so maybe I would now have less migraines. Was I let go because of my migraines?  Was this legal?  Should I consult a labour lawyer? I tried to stay calm, and focus on the fact that this sudden turn could open new doors and maybe become a good thing.  The icy HR lady even said that people do come to her a few years later to say that their firing was the best thing that had ever happened to them.  I looked at her in all her privilege and security, and thought about my age, my lack of a complete degree, and my illness.  I hoped that what she said would be true for me.  Three years later, I still can't say that.  I learned later that my position was the only one eliminated in a restructuring, but that a temp was kept to do my job for a while.  People told me not to take it personally, that this is how business operates, but it still felt and seemed personal.

What followed was a somewhat carefree year of freedom from stress, enjoying my new boyfriend, staying up late, playing lots of musical gigs, and finally, enrollment in hairdressing college at age 45!  I finished the program in my year off, but soon realized that my age was becoming a factor in being able to stand on my feet all day. And for me, sore feet lead to more migraines.  In hindsight, I see that it would have been best for me to have studied to become a hairdresser straight out of high school, but my academic proclivity made guidance counsellors steer me away from vocational school and into university.  And I would need to apprentice for 2,000 more hours for $11.40 an hour in order to earn my licence, while somehow managing to keep my home and feed myself.   

My severance money was running out and I was now on EI, earning more on EI than I would doing hair. It all just didn't seem to be worth it anymore.  I should have researched this career path more carefully:  the average hairdresser in Ontario makes $27,000.  The hairdressers I knew and envied were making double that, but that was after 25 years in the industry, with a curated and trusted clientele who would tip generously, and were usually self employed.  I had many interviews for hairdresser apprentice jobs, and was not able to land a job.  Friends mentioned my age, and that perhaps places like First Choice Haircutters preferred young malleable employees with blue highlights.  Self doubt crept in.  I could not believe that someone with my dazzling resume and long work history could not even land such a lowly paid entry position.

I began to let that dream die, and accepted that the $8,000 that I paid out of my own pocket to attend school was gone forever.  I consoled myself with thoughts of all the people I knew with expensive degrees, who were not working in fields of their choice. I tried to make peace with my lost dream, but the combination of anxiety, eroding self confidence, migraine pain, and looming money troubles sent me into a deep and intractable depression.  

I began to interview in earnest for other jobs, and endured 29 interviews.  Time after time I could see that I was up against very well educated people half my age with twice my energy, willing to work for peanuts.  These were desperate millenials or bright eyed new immigrants, who had learned early how cruel the economy has become to them, for whom benefits or union protections or paid days off or home ownership are a pipe dream.  In 1997 when I made $28,000 a year, I could buy a house, and I did.  The fact was driven home to me that any extras are just not offered anymore; or if they are, it takes decades to earn them.  

My EI ran out in August 2017, and I was still jobless.  I picked up a contract job that quickly fizzled.  I was secretly a little grateful, because it took 3 unreliable buses to get there each morning.  I was offered two other jobs that did not materialize:  the first inkling I had that one offer had fallen through, was when I showed up for work, and the employer wasn't there, then emailed me later to tell me that he couldn't hire me right now.   

I was now without any income or benefits.  I applied for help for my drug costs through Trillium, a provincial plan designed to help those who fall through the cracks.  The evaluation for benefits is based on the previous year's tax return, so I was stuck with a $2,500 annual deductible.  I had no choice but to ask my 77 year old low income parents for help.  I cannot function without these drugs.  My sibling Jo is a radical feminist activist, who is no stranger to using guerilla tactics to get a job done or find justice, and they took matters into their own hands, making deals for me to obtain triptans (expensive and effective migraine meds, not covered by Trillium, even with numerous special requests from my neurologist), going so far as to meet strangers behind dumpsters, kind nameless people she met on online groups who had spare ones lying around to give to me.  She created a GoFundMe group and canvassed her friends to help me not lose my home, my cats, or dignity.  There was nowhere else for me to turn as a homeowner with no income:  without a job, you can't access home equity; owning a home, you are disqualified for any social assistance.  Jo managed to wrangle enough money for me to live on for the ensuing six months with no income, until I finally landed a job in March 2018.  The donors were not people I knew; in fact, I received no help from my most affluent friends and acquaintances.  (One donor was an American plus sized pornstar!  She sent me $1200 and saved me from foreclosure.  I've never even met this woman, God bless her, but I could check out her videos at any time!).  I learned that some of the truest friends I will ever have are strangers, and people who I though were friends whom I could count on were not.

This entire experience was traumatizing and life shattering. The more hair raising details I posted on Facebook, the more personal messages I would receive from people who were going through something similar or worse:  friends I would never suspect were facing homelessness, using food banks, and being dejected to the point of suicidal ideation from living with chronic pain and depression.  These problems are so hidden and yet so widespread.  

My unravelling came about as a result of the financial rug being pulled out from under me.  My severe depression grew out of chronic money anxiety and having my self confidence snuffed out by so many rejections.  As my attitude became more hopeless, more rejections followed: bands dumped me, people I thought were forever friends vanished, and I lost my high energy and vitality for a time.  I found a new set of true rainy day friends, people who have supported me through thick and thin, who loved me back to the point where I could love myself again. There are three big factors that drive women into bankruptcy, and I have had them all:  widowhood, job loss, and a chronic health condition.  It was my family and strangers who prevented this from happening.

My new job pays $15 an hour.  My new salary is the same as what I made in 1997.  The people I work with cannot purchase homes on this income.  At least I have partial benefits now, and the work is full time and conveniently located.  I work in a downtown call centre, approving sub prime loans for other desperate people. I can relate to our clients in a unique and personal way.  My hours are such that I can't do all the volunteer work I used to do, and my income is so low that I cannot contribute to the economy in any meaningful way now.   I still can't pay all of my bills, and my phone was just cut off for a time, until another family bailout. I overhear the collections people asking ""what happened to make you fall behind on your payments?""  Oh boy, could I tell you a story.

707,Question on zomig and rebound headaches,"I usually get migraines right before my period, and I'll have headaches for about 5-7 days.straight. I take zomig each if those days. 

Occasionally I will also get a migraine outside of my period week (e.g. if I got poor sleep or its really hot). So I would say my average monthly zomig intake is 6-8 pills per month. I've been doing this for about three years. I'm on the contraceptive pill and some months I skip my period, during a skipped period week I'll only get a light migraine for a day or two only.

I recently got a new doctor. She was a bit shocked by the amount of zomig I would take in a week (5-7pills of 2.5). My old doctor did not make any remarks on my usage.

So now I'm getting afraid that I might be over doing it I've read online one should take max 3 per week, but I feel so terrible during my week of period if I wasn't taking zomig. Should I just grind it through and not take zomig for half the week? Over the counter painkillers do zip zero nada to esse my migraine.

I'm a 26 year old female who never had a proper headache in her life.

Last week  I started to see some sparkles? , flashing lights etc. which lasted for at least half an hour.  Followed by a short headache. (happened two times in a day). I thought I'm going blind and went to the eye doctor immediately. He said my eyes are perfect. It must be migraine and neurologist confirmed.

Since then , I had few small headaches without aura. But my eyes gets blurry from time to time without headache. I don't know if I should use medication yet.

   I work in finance dep. with a really stressful environment. Last 3 years I worked under a lot of stress looking at a computer screen for at least 12 hours a day.  I also have stress at home with my family. I'm not sure if it is directly related to my migraine but i think it triggers me. Now I really fear of migraine preventing me from doing my job. My job is my only security for life. My family won't look after me if I would be depended on them. They don't care about me and they also took all my savings. My job pays fine but i have no savings yet , this also depresses me. Overall I'm alone in my life and get depression from time to time. I was ok with it but with my disease I started to fear for myself. Thinking about meditating or doing yoga for some positive energy in my life.

715,Altered sense of smell during migraine hangover?,"This is a new experience for me, and I could use some encouragement that it will eventually go away. Since my migraine ended at about 2:00 yesterday (and actually during the migraine as well, though I attributed that to the actual migraine itself) my sense of smell has been out of whack. Almost all foods, too me, smell spoiled. As a result, all I've been able to eat is simple chicken soup, saltine crackers, and pretzels/plain baked potato chips. 

Again, this isn't because of a stomach issue, it's because everything else smells so awful it makes my stomach turn. Fellow migraineurs, if you have some words of encouragement or advice on how deal, I would be so appreciative. ",,1,1

 So yesterday I tried again to refill it, and once again it was delayed. Then this afternoon I get a text saying it had been filled! Yay! Except when I looked at the email the quantity was wrong. Normally my script is for 90 pills (which I admit seems a little excessive) but this said quantity of 42. That's such a weird number, I mean it's not even half of the 90.

 I called the pharmacy to find out what the deal is and they told me my insurance would only approve 7 days worth.The woman I talked to said they are encountering more and more insurance policies that only allow them to issue 7 days worth at a time. Has anyone else experienced this?",,1,1

I'm usually just an aura guy. But the last week or so I've been getting pretty painful jolts in my head, always in roughly the same area (above the right temple). Feels sharp and stabby. Lasts for the blink of an eye. This happens maybe 5 times a day or something. Are these ice pick headaches? 

And is there any way to make them go away? This is not particularly pleasant. It's been hot, I haven't been eating or sleeping very well and I've been working too much, and my neck feels pretty tense. So I guess any number of those could be contributing factors?

So I injected AIMOVIG on July 12th (which was shockingly covered) I haven’t seen a difference yet, but I’m still fairly optimistic...i know not everyone is super responders and it can take weeks to start working. (However I usually have one aura a month and I have not had one yet! My last one was June 9th so I’m technically over due on that, yay) 

I start physical therapy July 31st.

With this flare up I’ve gotten LOTS of ear and neck pain, so my neurologist suggest some trigger point injections while we wait...can we just talk about that needle length?? 

They did way more than I expected around my ears, in my scalp, down my neck, and my back...

when she went into the muscle of my neck on the right side(my problem side and where I’m really tight) it was the most relieving/uncomfortable feeling ever it was like deflating tension mixed with a number spasm...here’s to hoping I find some relief! 

EDIT: after the anesthetic wore off I had the worst headache if my life. My migraines are nagging, painful but functional...not omg I want to die.

She warned me it could inflame things more and hurt before the steroid kicked in, and it seems like a side effect if decadron injection is indeed headache.

My migraines have been insane, intense, and literally continuous lately. I’m so sick of throwing up, losing my vision, and generally just being miserable. 

To top it off, I got very sick, got viral meningitis and because I’ve been so stressed out lately, I now have fucking shingles! And it hurts so bad but besides the Valtrex and ibuprofen, there’s nothing I can do but to suffer through it. While also dealing with my current migraine that is going on 6 days.

I want to scream and cry and rip my head off. Ugh, I know it fixes nothing to rant but I’m so wound up right now with all of this and personal shit going on!

Side note: I had shingles when I was three, so apparently it can flare up anytime, mainly brought on by stress. And since I already have severe anxiety, it was bound to flare up at some point. Im 25 btw.

I have been taking amitriptyline for about a year now as a migraine preventive. Started out on 10mg and gradually went up to 50mg once a day. About 3 weeks ago I cut it down to 25mg once a day. I have gained about 20 pounds while taking this med and don’t feel that it has helped my migraines enough to keep taking it- especially with the weight gain and other side effects I’ve had while taking it. So today my doctor prescribed trokendi xr (Topamax) to use as a preventive instead of the amitriptyline. She also gave me imitrex and zofran for when I do get a migraine. 

My question is: can I stop the amitriptyline as soon as I start the Topamax? I tapered down from 50 mg a day to 25mg a day about 3 weeks ago and have not experienced any withdrawal symptoms so far. I am just a little nervous about quitting it cold turkey although the doctor didn’t seem to think it would be an issue.

Thing is if I take aspirin in the right time it still subsides but if it gets slightly late I end up with nausea followed by puking.
So starting June 2nd week I stopped drinking milk or stopped having milk in my tea(Avid tea drinker), I still had yoghurt once in a while. 
Today is almost the last week of July and I had aspirin just once.

734,Wondering if anyone has experienced this...,"After nearly 8 years I have been able to put some significant time between migraines. At this point, I probably get at the most one a month, which sometimes culminates in a few days of migraines or I find myself extra sensitive to triggering more, so I have to take it easy and watch what I eat and my activity level/types for a weekish. 

I feel bad posting my success knowing how many people on here are suffering daily, but maybe it will grant a little hope that with perseverance and understanding, relief can be (somewhat) achieved! 

However, lately I have been experiencing something strange and I’m not sure if I should be concerned or not. I haven’t been able to track it yet because it comes on so suddenly and doesn’t seem to have an immediate trigger. I will find myself experiencing a sudden-onset of intense pain on one temple or right above my eye. It is painful enough that I have to stop what I’m doing and can’t talk. I usually instinctually press my hand to my temple and close my eyes until it’s gone (obviously not if I’m driving!).  They probably last 15-20 seconds. I’d say in the past week it has probably happened twice that I can remember vividly.

You can't blame them, they just don't know what you're going through, and let's be honest: why should they care?  
We live in a society in which for most of the people migraines are just an annoying think, not a freaking painful one, it's normal that a lot of people don't know what a migraine really is, surely, things will change in the future, but for now, just stop being salty about someone who's trying to be nice.

739,Middle of the night migraine groundhog day,"TL:DR help - fed up with being woken up at 3am into a full blown migraine

Around seven weeks ago i started getting migraines in the very early hours in the morning, mostly full on migraines which dont cease after I manage to get back to sleep - usually waking up with the other hemisphere under the shadow.


I have a long history with general migraines - starting way back when I was 14 and suffered on and off ever since with the usual onset being loss of data from my eyes (missing eye on people faces etc) tunnel vision, light &amp; sound sensitivity - all prompting me to take meds and get to a safe place. taken too many tablets,  written too many diary's found a few things that trigger but I still get them.


These night time migraines though are not presenting themselves, I'm just waking up in pain pretty much every night. Have completely restricted my diet, stopped driving (mainly due to meds and stress), stopped using screens/devices and am taking all the usual vitamins/electrolytes as well as watching my fluid intake.
Currently awaiting Neurology appointment which was supposed to be four weeks ago but nearest I can be seen is mid Sept - have been signed off work for the last 4 weeks, been told to pop back every 2 weeks for a review.
I'm taking mixture of codine and infralax which is numbing some of the pain though my insides are upside down most of the time.


Tried taking different preventatives every night before I sleep which  has not worked. Been to osteopath who stated my  body wasn't balanced and did some work on me  from foot up to head, been to the migraine clinic who spent a long time taking notes and then suggested a course of Botox injections (one thing I'm not prepared to do). Beginning to loose the plot, getting snappy with family, friends, people on the road etc and fed up with being miserable, though i'm known to be a grumpy sod.


A few other things to mention, started to wake up in the middle of the night late last year at the same time (just before 3am) though did not have any pain, just felt shit (put it down to been abruptly woken up) though this went away after I started a new diet (Atkins). We thought one of the neighbors was waking me up though we never found out why, so thinking that I have had this for longer but its just started to bring on the migraines this time around.


I come from a family which is plagued by migraines, my Father and Mother suffer though have had less attacks in later life.

Wondering if anyone else gets woken up like this, has ever found a reason why or way to stop it.

When I first had them, excedrin was effective, but this year they've skyrocketed. The excedrin wasn't working anymore and I was getting them too frequently to be taking excedrin all the time.  I was prescribed Imitrex, which works wonderfully, but the past few months I've been running out before my insurance will pay for more. I did try topamax for a few days, but quit because I was barely functional at work. I also read about some side effects that seemed pretty scary.

I'm feeling quite frustrated with my primary doctor. It almost seems like she doesn't take me seriously and she just wants to throw more medications at me.

749,How long does nortryptaline withdrawal last?,"I decided to ""taper"" off my nortryptaline, which I prescribed years ago for chronic tension headaches. They kept upping the dose to 75 mg, and it helped reduce the frequency of the headaches, but then I started getting migraines, and they went chronic. So for a long time now I've been wanting to get off the nortryptaline since it doesn't seem like its doing anything if I'm getting migraines 28 days a month. The doctors have all been very against this idea, but finally I was insistent, especially after starting beta blockers and seeing a significant reduction in my migraines. They told me to go from 50mg to 25mg for 2 weeks, then just stop (I had made the drop from 75 to 50 on my own a few months ago when I was running low on pills) . I was surprised they didn't want me to taper down more slowly.

So I've been on 25mg for 2 weeks now, and the past week or so has been hell. Besides nightmares and insomnia the first few days, I've been major fatigue and  nearly constant tension headaches mixed in with more frequent migraines. I've had  3 migraines in the past 24 hours. One will feel better, then another will start up on the other side of my head. Last week I could only work 1 day a week due to the pain. 

Does anyone know how long this withdrawal period might last? I'm wondering at what point I will know whether I actually need to be on at least 50mg of nortryptaline or not, if I keep having these chronic headaches/migraines. I'm not going to drop to 0mg tonight since it's been so bad the past week just dropping from 50mg to 25mg. But how much longer should I hold out? I was thinking 1 more week? And then if I don't feel better increase back up to 50mg?

750,Is this an ocular migraine? Symptoms with a catch...,"To start - I have spoken to a doctor. I regularly see a neurologist for narcolepsy. When I mentioned my symptoms, he said there was no correlation to what I was experiencing and narcolepsy, and is most likely an ocular migraine. He didn't seem 100% convinced though, and I haven't been able to find anything definitive via google. So I thought I'd ask here, where I'm sure a lot of you have done a ton of research, not to mention personal experiences. 

I'm a 23-year-old female. I've experienced this a total of 3 times, each at least a month apart, and it's always the same. In the lower left peripheral of my left eye, I'll see a circle made up of cross hatches in bright pink and blue colors. The first two times only had one circle, but the third time had two of the same circle overlapping a bit. The circles aren't very large - big enough to grab my attention and be a distraction but nothing that impairs my vision when looking straight ahead. They're mostly solid with a little bit of flashing in and out. 

There are two catches: the first is that it only lasts a few seconds - 20 at most. All the googling I've done states that to be classified as an ocular migraine, it has to last at least 5 minutes and generally up to 60. The second catch is that all three instances were completely without pain and I have never in my life had a migraine (the only exception being if these three instances somehow count as painless ocular migraines). 

The closest I've ever come to migraines is when I have headaches that resemble cluster headaches. They consist of sharp, intense pain in a single concentrated area on one side of my head that last several minutes (probably up to around 15). However, they're not true cluster headaches in that I get no symptoms in my eye or nose and they don't occur daily for a period of several weeks. They're random and intermittent.

Family history: My dad has been getting ocular migraines since his mid-twenties. He sees a reverse flashing jagged ""C"" in the center of his vision. They last 20-30 minutes and always occur without pain. My dad and I share a tendency towards low blood pressure, to which he attributes his ocular migraines (I'm not sure if this is true or not). My sister and my mother experience occasional migraines, and my maternal aunt has chronic migraines - all three of them with regular migraines consisting of pain but no visual effects.

751,Colleagues that. Just. Don’t. Get. It.,"I have a generally lovely colleague who will make a comment every time I have any kind of problem with a trigger (the main one I struggle with being light flashes but this concerns another, oranges). I asked everyone at work if they would mind holding off eating them near me and explained why. A newish colleague forgot to today and I walked straight into the meeting room to get away from it. The usually lovely (if blunt) colleague stuck her head in to see how I was only to reply when I said I had a headache, ‘Are you sure it’s not psychosomatic? Try to stop thinking about it. ‘

She’s said the same when I was diagnosed with Crohn’s (well, you seem to be making a big deal out of it, you seemed fine before) and I’ve tried to talk to her, educate her a little bit she doesn’t get it. I don’t ask if her gum disease or sore hip are all in her mind... maybe I should? Any words of wisdom so I don’t bite her head off?",,1,1
752,Aaaarggh,"I've got one of those migraines right now that aren't the worst on the pain scale, but that just will not go away. Meds don't help, eating, drinking, moving, sitting, lying down, sleeping, hot showers, ice packs, acupressure, nothing will help or ease the pain even for a second. It just stays consistently the same, but it's sharp enough that I can't do anything. I can't even sleep. I got groceries and tried to watch some TV in the hopes that if I pretend it doesn't exist it'll go away, but it didn't happen.

Honestly, I'd rather have an attack that's like 8-9 on the pain scale that goes away eventually, than this stupid 4 that just goes on and on. I'd be useless for a day or two, but I'd be asleep for most of that. Now I'm useless, bored, can't do anything, can't sleep, and can't ease the pain in any way. ",,1,1
753,Preventative medicines -- Nortriptyline vs Memantine vs ???,"I've been suffering with migraines without aura from 4, but they've gotten worse in the last couple years. It's hard for me to go to work or school like a normal person in the attacks that can last 1-2 weeks. The worst part of them is the inflammation on the left side of my face. My left eye and nostril feel like they're going to burst from the pressure.

I've been using Ibuprofen for over a decade. Tylenol doesn't work, maybe because it's not anti-inflammatory. I've reached the point where I'm starting to get consistent nosebleeds since Ibuprofen is a blood thinner. The doctors I've seen have determined I need to reduce my reactive medicine usage and move to a preventative model.

I haven't tried any before, but the specialist recommended trying Memantine, then Nortriptyline if Memantine doesn't work. My primary care, however, suggested Nortriptyline first since it's been used for migraines for much longer and is what they're familiar with. What do I do? When I did preliminary research, I only saw Nortriptyline and did not expect to hear about Memantine in my first appointment.",,1,1
754,Migraine Rant,"Ok so a little background on me: I was diagnosed with chronic migraines when I was about 8. I’ve been having migraines since I was about 5 (I am 17 now). From my years 5-10 my migraines could be more compared to pressure headaches, I would get them for about 30min-2 hours. They would feel like a rubber band was wrapped around my head tight enough to the point of my head feeling as if it would explode. Once I hit middle school though my migraines got really bad. Instead of feeling them around my head they moved right to my eye. They would feel like someone was stabbing my eye with an ice pick while also being punched simultaneously. Instead of last only 2 hours these migraines could last upwards to 5-6 hours. They would be so bad where I would cry for hours which would just make it worse. There have been times where I would have a constant migraine for days on end, this would lead to me going to the emergency room so that I could get morphine in order to get rid of my migraine (sounds like over kill but I was seriously in this much pain). I could no longer take a Ibuprofen or Tylenol on it’s own to get rid of the migraine. Instead I’d have to take about 2-3 Ibuprofen (200mg) and then take a nap (usually 2-4 hours) in order to get rid of the migraine completely. Throughout middle school I missed at least 20-25 days per year due to waking up with migraines. I would also frequently leave school during the day due to migraines (1-2 times a per month. This heavily affected my grades and my learning capabilities and still affects me to this day. It dosent help that I have Tourette’s syndrome and depression. I should also add that I have take many prescription pills that were either supposed to prevent migraines or relive migraines while they were happening. The preventive pills I took never worked they always made my migraines happen more often or even stronger. So I eventually stopped taking them due to the frustration I had with them. The pills I took to get rid of my migraines would work for a little bit but would eventually I would need a stronger prescription. So eventually I stopped taking those too. From late 7th grade to early 10th grade I would just take 2 Tylenol (500mg) and take a nap to get rid of my migraines.  Lately though my mom has been giving me these pills called “Pamprin”(yes I know they are used for menstrual pain relief) they work really great and get rid of my migraines within 30 min and I don’t have to sleep after I take them for my migraine to completely go away. This isn’t always the case though, there are times when I have really bad migraines that I simply can’t beat. When I have these my mom gives me “sumatriptan” (she too suffers from chronic migraines) this works great n all but when I have to take this pill I’m at the stage where I start vomiting which means I have the hard task of taking the pill and keeping it down for 1 hour so it can help me. To conclude this post was just to rant and share my experience with having to deal with migraines and how I’ve combat them. Before I end this though is there anyone here who have experimented with CBD? Lately I have been testing it to see if it will help my migraines and it truly has. Sometimes I will take CBD drops or just smoke a bowl when I feel a migraine coming on and it has helped the pain and has helped me relax. While weed hasn’t completely taken the migraines away it has allowed me to take 1 Tylenol (in addition to a bowl or CBD drop) to get rid of my migraines. If you’ve made it this far thanks for reading my story and I hope to hear your insight on this bullshit of disease. ",,1,1

757,Does food impact your migraines?,"So I'm not going to get into all of my symptoms, timeline ETC (I really just need to make a few good graphs and charts so I can attach them) because it's just too much but one area that I've had a really hard time finding anyone who relates even remotely is how food impacts my migraines. But here's the deal- I eat food, inclusive of smoothies, soup, even a tic tac and surprisingly multivitamins (but not other vitamins as far as I can tell) and my body has a sympathetic as opposed to a parasympathetic response. I often run a fever usually of 99.7 farenheit or 37.6 Celsius up to 102 or 38.8 (rarely hitting the super high end though) and my normal body temperature is between 96 and 97 farenheit for reference. The other much bigger problem for me is that is makes the pain so much worse. Like bones crushing in your body bad and none of my doctors have figured this one out but while migraines should be typically isolated ipsilaterally to the head mine are ipsilateral to my entire body and I stay in tetanus for most of the day but eating anything will make that worse. The only relief I've found is freezing myself out because you know, if you can't feel anything you're good to go and then after I've gone about 18-24 hours without food the pain starts to subside but then you run into some other issues naturally, like dying or whatever. Then the best solution I've found is exercise but it has to be pretty intense to work which I don't mind because I've always enjoyed it anyway.  I know I sound like a walking definition of an eating disorder but I promise I don't actually enjoy getting told by random girls ""You know boys don't like girls who are underweight"" or hearing ""Eat a hamburger!"" for the thousandth time, as if that would somehow be useful to anyone ever.

P.S My best hypothesis that my issues with food are related to the actual metabolizing process not the digestion as I have no issues with that and no stomach problems to speak of and it would make more sense with the multivitamins.

Sorry for all my weird rambling though, if you have any weird food/migraine stuff I'd love to hear it even if its opposite or just your thoughts in general. A I apologize if anything made absolutely no sense, I'm also in the middle of packing up my apartment which I actively loathe doing. ",,1,1

764,I think Effexor is really helping my migraines,"Hi all! I wanted to share my migraine story and maybe it will encourage you to keep on dealing with the doctors and the meds and trying new ones.


I've had migraines since I was 6. That's 35 years of them. I have bad reactions to the triptans (my chest tightens and I can't breathe) so for decades all I got was fiorcet and my otc meds. I've tried neurontin, propanolol, nortriptyline, amytriptyline, caffergot, botox--anything my doctors suggested I'd do. I've cut carbs out of my life, no chocolate, no wine, no soft cheese (that last one hurts the most!). And still, I have 4-5 headaches and migraines a week.


And then recently I realized how depressed I was because how can we not be, right? That much chronic pain, the light, sound, and smell sensibilities. I couldn't get out of bed that much anymore. My entire life was just waiting for my next migraine. I even started aimovig and there was no real effect. (Still trying it though!) So I took a drastic step. I asked my doctor for Effexor.


I've been on antidepressants before and I didn't love them. I gained weight which made me more depressed. But I needed to do something. I was terrified of the side effects and the warnings about weaning off. But I tried it. And I've had three days straight of no migraines, which is unheard of. The migraines I get aren't that strong anymore. I can take an excedrin or half a fioricet tab. And mood wise, I feel positive for the first time in a while. I guess I didn't realize how much my migraines were affecting me. I thought just lying on the sofa or in bed all day was normal. The side effects aren't that intense for me, just nausea. But I was already so nauseated all the time that I can deal with it.


I know effexor doesn't work for everyone. The searches in various reddits about it are terrifying. But I think I found something that works for me. It only took 30 plus years. So if you're not finding the meds for you, keep trying. Keep going. Don't give up. I know we won't all find something that works, and who knows, maybe in a few months I won't have as good results. But you might have your Holy Shit this works moment. 

Maybe there's hope after all, right?",,1,1
765,Back-of-Head (Occipital) Pain on One Side. Migraine or Chiari?,"*Disclaimer:  I don't have health insurance but am working on it.  Thus I can't see a specialist or even a regularist, haha.  Just looking for opinions of other migraineurs.*

I never had a migraine in my life until I hit 31.  Now they're 15+ days per month.  I have the typical triggers of hormones, crying &amp; barometric pressure changes...get a noticeable prodrome &amp; postdrome before/after my headaches &amp; have other 'typical' migraine symptoms like you all.  My old physician didn't seem concerned that I developed these 2-3 day headaches &amp; instantly labeled them 'migraines'.  No secondary tests or anything.  Fioricet works as an abortive &amp; I take Topamax daily with no real improvement.

But I have this nagging fear in my mind.  My brother had a Chiari malformation that required emergency surgery when he was younger.  If you're not familiar w/ Chiari, it can start causing symptoms at any age for no real reason &amp; is caused by your cerebellar tonsils descending out of your skull into your spine.  A lot of people go their whole lives w/ no symptoms &amp; only are diagnosed w/ an MRI...others have problems from birth or don't get sick until adulthood.  *It's hereditary to a degree &amp; there have been families where it is present in several siblings* but this is not always the case.  That's the bit that scares me.  Not a whole lot is known about how it works or just HOW genetic it is.  

Symptoms can overlap w/ migraine which makes it hard to diagnose from symptoms alone.  I've never had any of the dizziness, vomiting or other Chiari symptoms but the back of my head throbbing is worrisome as that's the #1 symptom of Chiari--occipital headaches.  However I DO suffer chronic fatigue &amp; some other [POTS] (https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/postural-orthostatic-tachycardia)-like symptoms that can be present in Chiari.  Lots of weird health issues that have gotten worse in the last few years since the migraines started...

My migraines typically radiate from the back left side of my head near my neck; sometimes they happen on the right lower side about 10% of the time.  The pain is dull &amp; throbbing and made worse by noise/light.  No nausea (thank god).  

**How much of this sounds like typical migraines vs. something more serious?  I know y'all aren't doctors** &amp; can't diagnose me definitively but I just need some opinions besides mine that aren't tainted by anxiety &amp; OCD, hah. ",,1,1
766,The worst timing.,"I spent yesterday hanging out in a quiet, dark apartment because my boyfriend had a terrible migraine. (Y’all, it’s so nice to have a partner that understands migraines.)

So a couple members of my family were in town and invited us to eat. I politely declined for him but went by myself. Halfway to the restaurant, my head started hurting a little. By the time I sat at the table, I was nauseous. But I haven’t thrown up from a migraine in years. I’ve been lucky. 

My family told me there was ibuprofen in the car so I ran out to grab it. Puked in the bushes. Embarrassing enough but no one really saw. Go back inside thinking ‘cool, my head will start to ease up.’ NOPE. 

I barely touch my dinner that my family is paying for. I’m telling myself that I can leave in a few minutes because everyone is almost done. And then they order dessert. And the waiter brings the wrong dessert. Finally, they get up to leave. 

I stand up and walk outside with one person while the other two go to the bathroom. Y’all. Should’ve gone to the bathroom. My family member was asking me about my migraine and I puked again. In the bushes. 

I’m never going back to that restaurant, I’m so embarrassed.

We don't live together so he hasn't exactly seen me go through one physically he has only heard me complain. 
Last week we made plans to meet up but it wasn't anything special and I got a horrible migraine. I had to go home I couldn't meet him. All I wanted was the darkness and my bed. He didn't say anything at that time but then after a week he picked a fight with me. He started saying things like I put everything on my migraines. 
He always keeps saying things like I think you come over to just sleep and when I blank out he says that I am not interested in talking to him so I am always lost at how to explain what's going on in my head. Then all on top of that he says that he is lost in the relationship because I don't do anything.

768,Who should I see next to deal with chronic headache? (had over 10 years),"Headache started about a week after getting popped in the head during a sparring session while doing boxing. I didn't go out or anything, just things went black for a second. I've tried a ton of meds, the only ones that worked were amitryptiline and effexor, but both eventually stopped working. MRI and CT scans came back negative. 

Went through one neurologist and doctor who basically said there was nothing more they could do. Tried a couple chiropractors. I also went to a couple headache clinics. The last headache clinic I went to in Philadelphia (I live in NY) recommended trying botox injections. So I did a couple rounds of that with no relief. 

So who should I go to next? Another neuro? A chronic pain management doctor? Basically, how do I find someone who will take on a hard case? Who's the best of the best for dealing with this issue? I'll get on a plane, climb to some monastery in the himalayan mountains, or where ever else I have to go to find someone who can treat this effectively. 

I already had depression before this started and now it just feels like someone wants me to kill myself because this time of the year is the worst. Temperature seems to make it worst as well as not getting enough sleep. Maybe I just need to sleep more even though it's tough as hell for me get to sleep. I have to take meds (Remeron) to help me sleep.

I've noticed my neck is occasionally sore when I wake up but that could be due to the pillow I'm using which I'm going to replace soon. soon. I'm just at a loss because I've been tried a lot of things but without any real relief. It gets...tough to deal with, especially when I'm already in a bad place. Any advice would be much appreciated.

769,Eyes rolling back and stiffness of the neck?,"Hello, migraineurs. Long-time sufferer, first-time poster! I was diagnosed when I was 12 and have been suffering on and off ever since.

This week I had a migraine that lasted three days, so my doctor sent me a script for prochlorperazine. This was my first time taking it. I took all three doses throughout the day, and the migraine eased up a little. I thought that was that.

The next day I got up, took the first of my doses, and decided to go about my day. I was feeling very strange, however; not migraine-strange, but different. By 4 PM, my eyes had suddenly rolled into the back of my head and wouldn't go down. Then my neck stiffened and began spasming, so I couldn't turn my head to the right or bring my chin down. Finally, I lost control of my limbs and collapsed onto the floor while I was in the bathroom. I crawled onto my bed, now experiencing a full-blown panic attack, and had Siri dial my mother for help. (Yes, I'm 26 and still call mommy when I'm upset. I know, I know.)

It took about two hours for this fit to subside. I had to keep my eyes covered, took two emergency Xanax and a muscle relaxer (I'm also a fibromyalgia sufferer), and laid in my bed until the twitching and spamsing subsided. I slept for about 12 hours after that. Once I woke up the next day, I Googled my symptoms and found something called ""oculogyric crisis."" That seems to fit the bill, but I'm not really sure... And honestly, I'm terrified. It was awful to not be in control of my body for so long. It's the weekend, so I can't dial up my primary and go ""AAAAH MY HEAD FREAKED OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME.""

Has anyone experienced these symptoms in tandem with migraines before? Any input will help comfort me. My mother is convinced that it was a regular panic attack and I should stop taking all of my medications because they're only making things worse (!!!!!) so I would really appreciate an outside opinion.

Thank you!

**EDIT for anyone who might experience this**: I was told this is an ""extrapyramidal response"" to the medication. It's an extremely rare side effect with very little information available. Figures, right? I hope no one else has to go through this during their treatments; it's terrifying!",,1,1
770,"Becoming stupid, and KNOWING you're becoming stupid in that moment... (mild vent)","it is really strange and depressing to not function at your normal intelligence, KNOW you aren't functioning at your normal levels, AND have a ""normal level"" (for you) of intelligence -- which you've had your entire life before chronic migraines -- to compare to.

I'm not on Topamax (haven't been for over half a  year), but after 2 really good cognitive days after round 2 of Botox, today I literally just cannot hold a thought in my head beyond 2 seconds.  E.g., I went to transfer 2 three-digit numbers to another screen, and in the time it took to minimize 1 window and click in the field to start typing, every number was just gone.  Repeatedly.  (I couldn't copy/paste from the fields, unfortunately.  I resorted to screenshots.)  

Before that, I had to data-enter 3 things someone requested.  I didn't copy/paste, because I thought I had it (before I realized I was just stupid).  Screwed up 2 of the three by using completely the wrong words entirely.

Another task today, I had to data-entry something using the same information in 3 different pages, in order, and link them using the previous page's information.  Between forgetting to change a field to overwriting the wrong form, I just gave up and wrote this instead.  Things which should take no more than 5 or 10 minutes are taking...  a LOT more than that...  If they get done at all.

Even just holding a conversation with another person is hard; to the point where I just gave up answering the phone even for a friend who has seen this a thousand times before.

I imagine if I didn't have anything to compare to and this was all I knew, it might be less depressing.  Maybe?  But to go from a Ph.D. program to legitimately contemplating becoming a maid (something that doesn't require talking or almost any cognitive function ( at least I hope...)) is just soul-crushing... **

Yeah, I'll have to literally carry around a laminated piece of paper and erasable marker to check off that the task was done for that room...  And yeah, the other 1/3 of the time (when I have decent cognitive functions) I'll be bored out of my mind....

But at least I'll be...  Somewhat useful?  Or at least earning money?  

(I was rejected from unemployment because (in my state) working at a university while also being a student there makes your position exempt, so even though I've been working there for 4 years, I don't meet the minimum requirements to collect anything at all.  Who knew.)

This is not -- in a million years -- where I imagined my life going, that's for sure...

773,I'm at a loss (rant),"I've just been diagnosed properly for the first time. I've had migraines for a couple of years (after having them years ago as a teen) now but over the past 12 months they've gotten oh so much worse. 

The other week, I saw a neurologist who told me that I was wasting his time as it's just headaches (ie migraine and tension headache) and my gp can help me (I've seen several gps over the last year and they don't know what to do, hence the referral!)

I was gutted, it did not help as I've been partly blaming myself for the pain. Blaming my anxiety, not eating right, thinking I'm exaggerating, etc.

Fortunately, I had 2 referrals put in within a week - one after a standard appointment and one put through after as an emergency after I passed out at the doctors. So after I saw the first neurologist, another letter came through for another appointment at a different hospital. 

My symptoms have been getting quite a bit worse in the past few weeks. I couldn't tell you the last time I didn't have a headache. I'm always tired - often sleeping the whole day whilst my son is at school. I'm sore all over. I have permanent neck and back ache. Always feeling guilty about asking for too much from those closest to me or for not keeping in touch with people. 

Well, a couple of days ago I had my second appointment. He was so thorough, understanding and knowledgeable. He sees people like me all the time. After he went through my symptoms, he sat me down and looked me in the eye and said: this is not just a headache. You have chronic migraine and most, if not all, of your symptoms are caused by this. 
He thinks they were triggered in the first place by sinus surgery I had 4 years ago. Add on to that some serious emotional distress over the past 18 months and here I am. He told me what I have is a disability and I will always have it but here's a care plan to get you as well as we can.

What I'm worried about is always being in this phase. Nothing has worked for me so far. I'm over feeling like I'm living in a fog. The only thing I've found that has given me any relief is cannabis, and that's illegal here.

 I'm feeling relieved that I have a diagnosis and that I have a specialist on my side who agrees I can't work like this (I tried to go out for an hour earlier and nearly passed out, thank goodness I had my partner with me!). But I hate not working. I miss it! I'm thinking I might never be able to teach again. It's too stressful, even if I'm well if be too scared to trigger it again. I can't look after my son. 

I'm starting to stop blaming myself - there is nothing I could have done to prevent this. But that means I can't just stop it either. Its going to take work and effort - something I don't have the energy for. Sometimes I just want to end it all but I won't. I have to be here for my boy. I just wish I could make the pain and the fog go away.

It’s frustrating because people normally don’t outright say that they think I’m being a wuss or making excuses but I can tell they don’t get it from their ‘whatever ‘ attitude . So I feel like I don’t have an opening to explain what’s happening.

I thought about just starting to call it by a different name entirely or just name one of the symptoms since people seem to think it’s “just a headache”. 

The only way I’ve found to get taken seriously is to just throw up as soon as possible 🙄 preferably where everyone can hear/see 😑 ugh",,1,1
775,A complete meltdown,"For the last 2 years I've had chronic migraines. 3 to 4 days of each week I spend curled up in bed, moving is agony &amp; with the days of relief come a million and one chores. Grocery stores, house keeping, laundry and vet visits all done in the few good days &amp; all done while wearing a standard T-shirt &amp; Sophies (cheer shorts). It's easy to forget about myself, what I look like, what my hair color is and how much I weigh. Who has time to think about that when you have $17,000 of outstanding medical debt from cancer &amp; migraines that you can't pay because you can't keep a job because you literally want to die 4 random days of the week... 

Tomorrow is my 32nd birthday &amp; my fiance really wanted to make sure I had a good weekend. He booked a table at our favorite restaurant, one that we haven't been to in a very long time. The kind of place with long white table cloths &amp; wine served by the bottle. We don't have a lot but we have enough for a treat like this every once in a while. I've been looking forward to it all week. Then I put my clothes on... Or at least I tried to.

See it's easy to forget that you've gained 20lbs when you only wear the same worn in shorts &amp; decades old T-shirts. It's easy to forget that the WHBM dark wash denim you have, that hugs your curves so we'll, now make you look like an overstuffed sausage. The worn out ""size to big"" bra now the only one in your whole expensive, Victoria's secret drawer that fits.

He said he'd take me shopping right now, find me something I am comfortable wearing, but I am an absolute mess. We will not be going to my favorite restaurant, we will not be celebrating my birthday. Fuck you migraines, you are a curse that has ruined my life.",,1,1
