**1. Giving/Asking for Medical Advice**

No users have been verified as doctors, so nobody here is qualified to give out such advice. Even so, back issues are very unique and complex. They require a full and proper assessment, something of which cannot be given over the internet by a stranger. I know some are doing so in good faith, but giving improper advice can be dangerous. 

Be careful of the information you find here, take everything with a grain of salt, and talk to a medical professional if you have any questions.

This does not apply to sharing personal experience or tips and exercises for general fitness.


**2. Advertising**

No advertising is allowed, do not use this sub to post about your products, they will be removed


**3. Unapproved Study**

No posting surveys or searching for participants for your research without contacting a moderator first.


**4. Drug Seeking**

Looking for information on obtaining medications is not allowed.


**5. Creating Drama**

Keep the drama to a minimum, we want helpful and constructive conversations here.


**6. Spam**

No spamming your blog posts, they do not lead to meaningful discussions.


If you have any questions about the rules, please post them here.

1,The First Steps For Dealing With Back Pain,"Do you have back pain and you're not sure what to do? Maybe you think you have exhausted all of your options, tried everything and you just aren't making any progress. Here are the steps we recommend if you have developed back pain, either acute or chronic (we are not doctors, this information has been gathered from research and personal experiences):

**1. See your general practitioner**

It is always a good first step to see your GP whenever you face a new health problem. When it comes to back pain they may recommend you to a specialist, suggest medication, or have you get an X-Ray or MRI.
Although you may not think your GP will be the best help, it is an important first step to let them know your situation, and that way you can rule out other conditions that may be causing the pain (such as a tumor).

**2. See a Physiotherapist**

The next step after you have ruled out the possibility of anything outside the realm of muscular or spinal problems causing your pain, is to see a good physiotherapist. Now we recommend physiotherapists over other specialists because they have the necessary skills to access your back problem, provide manual and physical therapy, while working with you to get better. The best physiotherapist will give a thorough assessment, explain what is wrong and what they are going to do to help you get better, then they will lead you through an exercise routine, may perform some manual therapy, and give you exercises to perform at home.

**3. Read [Back Mechanic](http://www.backfitpro.com/books/back-mechanic-the-mcgill-method-to-fix-back-pain/) by Stuart Mcgill**

This amazing book will provide you with everything you need to start healing your back pain on your own at home. From basic anatomy, to finding your pain triggers, to building your own recovery plan and exercise routine!

**4. See a [Mcgill Method Provider](http://www.backfitpro.com/backpain/provider/)**

A Mcgill Method Provider is a medical professional who has worked with [Professor Stuart Mcgill](http://www.backfitpro.com/about-us/); an esteemed back expert in the world of Biomechanics. Most of the time you are sent for an assessment by a clinician, but you can contact your nearest provider if you are interested. 

**5. Further Research**

The best thing you can do for yourself when suffering from back pain is to learn more about how your body works. We recommend any of Stuart Mcgill's books. Search for research studies, and fact based books from reputable sources. There is a lot of good information out there, but there is also a lot of bad stuff too.

Any steps you think we missed?",
2,Anyone have any tips for lower lumber back pain and how to deal with sitting/resting in the evenings?,"I have muscle/joint damage and arthritis in my lower back. Currently nearing the end of tapering off my 4 years of pain med addiction and getting into yoga and dieting. I tend to sleep long hours. Like 10 a night (got a sleep clinic booked in a month). But I try to be active in the day and stay as true to my daily routine with a fair amount of walking with my dog. Come evenings tho I like to read or watch tv/play a video game. But I cannot find any way to sit that doesn’t aggravate my pain. Which sometimes just leads me to lay down in bed. Which is bad I know. Coz that leads to different areas to flair up. I’ve been through different arm chairs/couches etc. Maybe there’s nothing that is gonna work. 

One bonus question. My mattress is kinda soft. Should I invest in a hard mattress? And try and sleep on my back? I sleep on my stomach. But could learn to sleep different. 

Anyway. Thought I’d ask coz searching around I’m not finding much from people with experience. Cheers! ",
3,"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu sparring last night, now I'm super stiff","I haven't been doing it that long but I notice that when I do I tend to be super stiff the next day, especially in my back.

For those of you unaware of what Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is, it's a combination of wrestling and submission, you spend a lot of time on your back and one of the main components of wrestling is to try to lay all your weight on a person to stop them from moving. Super simplified but I hope that explains an idea of what I go through.

I feel as though between my spine and back there's like a soft liquid sack, usually if I drag my fingers down my spine, I can feel it through my skin but right now I barely can. My neck feels like it's constantly being pushed forward as if my body is trying to turn into Mr. Burn's posture from the Simpsons. 

I'm sure in a day or two it will be fine, possibly even faster if I put an ice pack on or take a hot bath but I'm just looking for information on if this is something I should be really concerned about or just something where I should take things easy for the next couple days. ",

5,Lower Right Side Back Pain for Three Weeks,"I injured myself in a crossfit class while doing box step-ups.  The pain happened on the lower right side of my back, but then sub-sided and came back a few days later.  Again, the pain went away, but came back and stupidly, I continued to workout until one Saturday I was in too much pain.

It hurts when I sit, stand, bend over or am sitting in a certain position.  At first I thought it was my SI joint and I went to a chiropractor for adjustments and was prescribed roboxin and naproxen.  That seemed to be helping, but last week, I did some elliptical work and woke up in pain yet again.

I went to a pain center and got trigger point injections and zanaflex (I'm out of roboxin now) and those do not seem to work.  The chiropractor at the pain center says I sprained my back and the issue isn't my SI joint, but rather my L5S1 disc.  He also adjusted me, but I feel like he left me worse for ware because when I woke up the next morning I was in even more pain.

I managed to get predisone (I haven't taken it yet) and want to get a cortisone shot, but some friends have been saying its not necessary and that I just need to rest.  I'm just in a lot of pain and want to get back to being active.  

Anybody have any experience with a similar injury?",

7,Foundation training - ankle pain,"I recently discovered Eric Goodman's 12 minute video on foundation training and after doing a few times I can see where the beneficial effect for the back could come from. I have noticed that after the workouts though, I have had some pain in my ankles on the side of the ""ankle ball"". It happens when I extend my legs out into a wide stance.

10,Spasms,"In June of 2017, I was playing basketball with some friends in the drive way.

11,Back Pain Days After Hockey - Worried I Have To Quit,"Hi. I am looking for some advice. Sorry if this is the wrong place. I am 33, 6'3, 235lbs. I fell in love with playing hockey two years ago. This January I started having very bad back pain set in 1-3 days after playing. I feel great when I play. I usually feel great for the next day or two. But then my very lower middle of my back starts getting very sore. At times it can be incredibly bad. It will radiate into my hips and butt and linger for weeks. Needless to say I haven't been playing very often. I have asked my doctor and had no real help. She put me on anti- inflamatories and I started doing lots of stretches she recommended. But still last week I tried to play after feeling good for a month and now I am hurting again so bad. Im not sure what it could be. I hate to think that after finding hockey I will lose it this quick. It makes me feel so great to go out and play.",

Ibuprofen makes night and day difference for me. I take 400mg, 4 times per week (leave 3 sequential days without them). Unfortunately I do not have access to doctor. I've heard NSAID are bad long-term for multiple reasons. Anyone using them regularly? What's your dose?

14,This Inexpensive Product Is Helping Me Recover From My Spinal Fusion - I Have Included My Personal Story Here,,
15,Lower back pain (again),"Basically I've dealt with lower back pain on and off for years now (I'm currently 32). However over the last several months the periods of pain have been happening close together and lasting longer.

I'm not good at describing pain so bear with me. It's the middle of my lower back, definitely deep inside, it's a weird numb/burning/tingly feeling mixed with sharp jabs if I move the wrong way. Sometimes I'll get a radiating pain down my right hip/thigh/leg and my knee sometimes randomly buckles out of nowhere. On a scale of 1 to 10 I can feel it slowly starting as a 1, build up through the day, and I'm close to a high 7, sometimes pushing low to mid 9 by bedtime.

The pain will stay for a few days, previously would be a day or two, but my recent ""episode"" a few weeks ago lasted close to a solid week. Now it's happening again. It started yesterday and already today it feels more ""advanced"" by day 2 then it did last time on day 2.

Sitting is almost impossible, walking/standing sucks, but is better than sitting. Forget bending down, insane pain, nothing I take OTC touches it. Biofreeze works for a little bit. I get some relief by laying on my back and putting either a pillow or a rolled up blanket under my hips. I'll instantly feel somewhat relief when I do this, although the pain is never gone.

Some back story on me. Starting when I was 15 I went through several knee operations due to karate injuries (3 or 4 within 5 years). When I was 21 I had a major work related injury where I fell close to 2 feet straight on my right ankle and pretty much destroyed it. For close to 4 years I went through intense PT and multiple reconstruction surgeries.

I'm concerned that years of constantly walking on crutches and using a cane messed up my back by how my gate and weight distribution was messed up.

Also for work I am a mailman, I walk close to 13 miles a day in a city (lots of stairs), carrying and picking up heavy things all the time.

I really want to go to urgent care after work today, I'm just concerned about getting brushed aside because literally everyone has ""back pain"".

Edit: While walking in general sucks I feel a sharp jab everytime I extend and then step through with my right leg. The pain is constant while I'm up and walking, but there is that jab of sharp pain on the right that I don't get when I step with my left leg. ",

17,I have back pain after working at a standing desk all day.,"I am using a standing mat. I have a desk extender that elevates my laptop such that I can work on it with my arms at about a 90 degree angle. But, after even a bit of time I start to feel my pack, and constantly need to crack the bottom of it by hyper extending my back.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, I have had two back injuries weight lifting in the past. But, standing at this desk seems to be the worst thing for my back. For instance, this weekend I swam, wakeboarded, sat in cars for hours, and my back felt okay. But, now that I am back at my desk the problem is back.

Can anyone point me to a good resource for working at a standing desk properly?",
18,Upper back pain for the last 3 weeks,"Hey everyone, will try and keep it brief. 

I'm a 34 year old male who started getting an ache in bottom of neck/top of spine about 3 weeks ago during a week when I was doing more gym work than usual (C5/C6 area) and occasionally across shoulders. 

It’s been on and off since then, sometimes having days where I can have very little achiness, others (like today) can be quite discomforting and painful – I’ve also been feeling pain lower down the back sometimes too. It’s more a dull ache than a sharp pain. 

Also been getting the odd twinge/tingle in little fingers on each hand now and then. 

I don’t have it during the night so am able to sleep, usually wake up without pain (stopped sleeping on my front which may have helped) and take warm baths every night that helps, but I’ve found I’ve been feeling weaker and more tired during my gym sessions. 

I’ve got an appointment booked in with a physio for next week, but wondered if this sounds familiar to anyone and any advice on how to help it – mainly to put my mind at ease since I suffer with anxiety and am imagining the worst.

19,A study shows that lower back pain is being treated badly around the world!,,
20,DDD is now gone,"I'm now 31 years old when I was 18 I was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease triple D with something to do with my L2 L4 something and that my this words deteriorated their rub against each other and then got an x-ray the other the other day just to see how much it's gotten worse and they say there's nothing wrong with me. That I don't have DDD. I'm a a large guy 260 at 6'6"". My back has always hurt I just standing and doing the dishes hurts my lower back so bad sweeping and sweeping hurts my back and I'm not even talking about lifting stuff just everyday How Stuff sweeping and then bending over with a dustpan my back it just makes me want like I don't want any drugs I'm on methadone already. I've abused drugs in the past because of how bad the pain was and the doctors want to do anything and by the time they got me over to payment rent I had already been treated and prescribe Suboxone and right away he looked at my x-ray and he shook his head like oh boy looks like it hurts then he saw that I was once prescribed Suboxone. At that time I was also looking for something like a narcotic but I think instant release Percocets but now I can't get out of bed when I do try to get out of bed it takes me 3 or 4 times I trying to get up off the bed because I usually just fall back down on the bed so I'm wanting to know was the first X-ray tech or whoever reads them wrong or was the most recent one wrong to because if they say there's nothing wrong then why is my back hurts so bad binder I would love to have a surgery wake up and up and be gone

I've also applied for disability but that's not physically you could add to the list but ptss agoraphobic depression anxiety. 

So was my first X-ray tech wrong being completely wrong could my second most recent X-ray tech we also wrong and that I'm perfectly fine and if there's no pain whatsoever suggestions please",
21,"Spinal decompression side effects, what is your experience?","I replied to another comment earlier but decided to make it its own thread.

I've had two flare ups caused by a bulge in L5S1.

For the first flare up I went to see a physio, he ordered an mri that revealed a bulge and we got to work. We did a few rounds of decompression wich worked fine. It's difficult to say if it was the decompression or all the exercises I was doing. Anyway, a couple of months later I was mostly pain free, and remained that way for almost a year. 

A couple of months ago it flared up again for some obscure reason. I went to see the same psysio and we got decided to use the decompression again. I felt fine after a couple of sessions. After the third session I was absolutely ruined in my upper back, where I've never had any pain before. I could barely stand for the rest of the day and went straight to bed. It went away in a couple of days but it was properly scary. We decided to discontinue right away. I think the therapy decompressed my upper spine too much, causing pain. 

Has this ever happened to you when you've done some form of decompression? I can't find any literature on this side effect. Whenever I Google ""spinal decompression + anything"" all I find is quack articles dismissing any harmful side effects completely.",
22,Burning and numbness on one point in upper back.,"For over a month now, I've had a burning pain in just one point right under my left shoulderblade. It varies from a mild discomfort to sharp pain, and it seems like when I touch it there's a quarter-sized area of skin that feels sort of numb. When I touch it I feel pain under the skin, but not my finger running over it. My doctor sent me to a dermatologist just to double check it wasn't a skin issue, but she's thinking it's neurological with the nerves. Has anyone else had this issue?",
23,Subtle back soreness and discomfort not going away,"Hi everyone, I have mild scoliosis who I’ve seen a doctor for. He said it’s pretty mild and shouldn’t be bothered by it for now and for the most part Scoliosis hasn’t had a big impact on me in my life in terms of pain. I work as an occupational therapist (I know great career for people with back issues), and the last couple months the right mid and upper side of my back where the curve goes away from, I’ve had this annoying soreness that’s been lingering for several weeks now. I don’t remember picking up anything wrong. I do remember doing intense back stretches in my dance class at that time but wouldn’t that have gone away by now? Anyone know what this could be? ",
24,"Anyone have any tips for my mid, upper back pain or know what it is? I'll try to be very brief.","-hurts mid upper back usually in between the lats and spine, sometimes more left, sometimes right and occasionally around the shoulder blades too

-had it on and off, mild to bad for like 8 years now

-triggered by standing a lot all day, lifting insignificant things (randomly not always)

-the pain varies from sharp and a pulling feeling to an also sharp but cramp-like feeling

-back feels better after sleep and best in the morning 

-prone to COMPLETELY throwing back out and not being able to work or even move sometimes for a couple of days (although this only seems to happen twice a year)


I've had pain free periods but recently I haven't had a completely pain free day in almost 2 years. this leads me to believe recovery is possible but I have no clue how",
25,Any help appreciated,"On each side of my lower back, about 2 inches out from the center of my spine, around the sacroiliac crest I have two ""protrusions"" that feel like fat, or something.  A few times I have leaned back and put pressure on them, and they seemed to ""pop"" back in for a while, but then popped back out again.  They no longer pop back in, just always out now.  They don't really hurt, but my lower back goes out anytime I lift something even if I do it properly, like I have my Fiance tie my shoes now because I gave up.

Stretching makes it worse, working out makes it worse, sitting makes it worse, standing PERFECTLY straight up seems to be the best thing for me.  Walking, Running, Swimming, all seem to aggravate it no matter how slow or gently I go.

Let's see... Along my spine from those two nodules down, at about .5"" from the center of spine I can feel these muscles that feel very bumpy and there are like little smaller nodules, but if I press on them they hurt in a very strange like burning sensation that my brain screams ""STOP!"" when I do it.  There are probably 4-6 of them that tend to be at varying levels of swollen-ness.

I found the other day a spot in my left and right butt cheek that hurts REALLY bad, I had a massage stick and pressed it into the tissue and it hurt so bad I almost fell over.  I had tingling in my shoulders, and definitely assuming a nerve is involved.

I've been to 3 specialists, each said I have stenosis and when I showed them the large nodules that are on my sacro crests, they all 3 kinda went ""hmm..."" and said not to worry about them.

The thing is, whenever my back does go out, those things turn into little swollen round nodes, about 3x bigger than usual and they seem to like, inflate to where they actually feel like round balls the size of a large marble or a ping pong ball.

When I was younger I had an accident on a trampoline where I scorpioned really hard and couldn't breathe for about a minute, then had back pain since.

My lovely parents refused to believe me and told me to ""suck it up"" and now I'm mid 30's and about to lose my job because I can't seem to get it to stop going out.

When it goes out, it's shooting pain, I am stuck on the couch one leg up, if I try to sit up, bend, etc it's excruciating and if I try to fight through it I just can't, it's as if the nerves wont send the signals to get the muscles to flex right

Sometimes I can feel that it's about to go out, and if I stand up real straight and do some ""put hands on those bumps, push hips forward, lean back hold"" stretches it sort of helps, but usually I just have to go to sleep and hope it's better the next day.

I've been to 2 physical therapists, but apparently they don't want to deal with me.  They won't let me use their equipment, so I just get an ice pack and the Tens on me then sends me home.  I asked both why and they said there's been a rash of lower back pain patients in recent years suing them when they get hurt so they just don't even deal with it now, they give you printouts and tell you to do it at home so they aren't responsible.

I also have many spots on my bodies with muscles that I have to routinely massage to the point that I'm about to cry, including those ones in my butt cheeks, my shoulders, my neck, etc.  Basically for every part of my body there's at least 1-2 muscles that I have to work out weekly at least or they just keep tightening and tightening.

I noticed recently that when I cough, I feel this like ""bursting"" sensation, but it's not like painful, more just like ""Aaawww, what was that?"" and a bit of a tingle, but it usually is in the right side of the pube area of the groin, and sometimes when I cough it feels like something in the lumbar regions is flexing and ""bursting"" as well.

I saw a specialist last week to see if I have a hernia maybe, they said no.

They also looked at the two nodes on my sacro crest and said ""huh.. dunno"" even though I brought some printouts of this specific hernia that can occur there and he basically was like ""never heard of it, probably bullshit."" and didn't really seem to really care about looking into it further in spite of a few studies I printed out and brought him.

eh... let's see, that's about all I can think of, I'm not looking for a diagnosis or anything, just ideas in case I missed something.  Maybe something I haven't heard of or even noticed yet.

Thanks all, be amazing if someone had info I could use to better this because it's taking me down almost 1x a week at this point in so much pain I just kinda roll around on the couch moaning, I'm sure it's not as bad as some other people's, but I'd like to find a way to minimize it if possible.

Oh one doc also said I have ""Schmorles"" nodes, and he was an Indian doc that told me he usually only see's those in patients over the age of 60, and in people my age he said he usually only see's the damage in child laborers that carry massive loads at a young age.

Well lo and behold, my stepdad was basically a psychotic slave driver that had me rolling 200lb rounds of lodgepole into trucks when I was 7-18 nearly every weekend and I basically did spend my childhood laboring for him and thinking back I did remember a few times lifting heavy rounds and then laying under the truck for a while because it hurt, but it was NOTHING like now, it's like 10x more painful now.

THanks!

34,Annular Tear: Post PRP Log,"Few weeks ago (8/10/2018) I received an injection of my own concentrated platelets (PRP) into my two lumbar disc to treat my back pain. I’m going to log my progress here every week.

Background:

I’m 37 yo and I’ve been cycling competitively since 2008 and I’m a Data Analyst as my day job. I experienced a gradual onset of back pain and sciatica in 2010 which was resolved with rest from sport and therapy for few months. I also learned better back hygiene in the process from the therapist. Back pain would come and go few times a year and resolve on it own in a few days.

However since 2016, the pain became persistent and got worst that I cannot sprint on my bike. It was resolved again after rest, vacation and therapy. I resumed cycling for several months wo issues. 

At the end of 2016, I tweaked my back while doing a deadlift. This time it was different, a sharp stabbing pain with spasms. It was hard to get out of bed.  So I repeated the same cycle, rest, see therapist and PT then return to sport. This time the pain would come back sooner. I wasn’t able to ride my bike much longer and often. 

On Sept 2017 while sweeping the floor, I experienced a painful back spasms. Being so frustrated, I decided to get to the bottom of this. So I visited a Doctor and he ordered an MRI. MRI revealed an annular tear on two of my discs (L4-L5 and L5-S1). L5-S1 have a small bulge wo touching the nerve. Doctor recommended therapy again and off the bike. I come back few months later, but then my back is often sore and at times unstable. Even yard work trigger these pains. 

Anyway, I haven’t been cycling much since then. I even stopped training and racing.

I even tried not riding my bike for 8 straight weeks. Instead I worked on Foundation Training and strengthening my hip flexors with a bit of cardio in an elliptical machine. Low grade pain would fluctuate but it never go away during those 8 weeks. A second MRI few months ago showed no change. 

I sought few more specialists, one recommend to just tolerate the pain and the other steroid epidural injection. But these doesn’t fix the tears. This is when I decided to get an intradiscal PRP on both of my disc. 

Day 0: PRP injection

The procedure was quick but I was having an anxiety about a needle in my back so they gave me Valium. Blood draw was quick. Then the doctor and staff prepared the concentrated platelet solution from my blood. Then injected it into my two disc L4-L5 and L5-S1 with guided imagery while I was laying down on my stomach. It was mostly painless until the platelets are injected. The pain was sharp with pressure in the discs. Injection took about 15mins. It made my back stiff and more painful when I try to get off the operating table. I laid on the table for about 20mins until I can get off on my own with less pain, then my boyfriend drove me home.

Day 1-3: I rested mostly with brief walks. When I stand or sit too long, I feel the pressure in my discs. Laying down in my bed helps relieve the pressure.

Week 1: The pressure pain in my discs fluctuate throughout the day. By the end of the week I returned to prePRP pain and started to do some light Foundation Training exercises.

Week 2: I was coughing so much one night that I tweaked my back. The pain  was sharp when I move a certain way. So its a bit more than baseline though tolerable. The sharp pain would fluctuate based on my movements and it was giving me an anxiety. Doctor told me that I shouldn’t worry too much and this is a minor set back for a week. He told me to check back with him on week 4. He said continue with PT and even ellipticals as long as I can tolerate it which I’m now doing and not cause pain.

As I’m heading into the third week. The pain from coughing is reduced but still vulnerable to certain movements (mostly loaded lumbar flexion) . I’m trying hard to stay strong and patient. Its hard when you are dealing with this for years.

I’ll report back by the end of this week for week 3. As per my Doctor, the treatment should start working by week 3-4. In my case week 4-5.

35,"Large Protruding L5S1 pain for 4 years, not a good candidate for surgery. Looking for advice.","Hi,

I’ve been struggling with lower back pain for 4 plus years now.  I can’t run of lift anything for very long before I get acute pain in my lower back right where the l5s1 disc is located.  This also occurs when I sit for a long period or move so that I cause inflexion in my spine (leaning forward).  The sciatic pain isn’t bad anymore, but that pain where the disc is located has never gone.  I feel it everytime I even do little movements like leaning slightly forward to wash my hands.

I feel like at this point I’ve tried everything.  I’ve had 2 MRIs, had shots to help with the sciatica, done thousands of dollars worth of physio, seen a massage therapist for extended periods, seen my physiatrist, and consulted with a surgeon (but was told I wasn’t a good candidate because it would only releave the sciatic pain).  I spend a lot of time in the gym strenthening my core and glutes, and have a strict stretching routine do help with my tight hip flexors and lower back (Mackenzie exercises).

Anyways, I’m just frustrated living in pain everyday.  I use to play competitive sports but haven’t been able to run in over 4 years without having pretty significant pain in the disc area after I’ve finished.  If anyone has any suggestions, anything at all, I’d seriously welcome it.

Thanks so much in advance!!",
36,How to support someone in chronic pain,"My husband has been suffering from back pain for the past 9 weeks. No MRI, only X-Ray showing a healthy spine. Pain began 3 weeks after our son’s birth so we believe he damaged a disc holding him incorrectly. 3 doctors recommending PT which he began last week.

38,Herniated Disc L4/L5 with Annular tear,"Around 4 years ago, I turned over in bed and felt pain down my quads, lower back, down the leg to the top of the foot. After receiving an X-rays and MRI, I was told that I have an L4/L5 herniated disc with annular tear. 

I was very active prior to the injury. As of now my only activity is swimming and physical therapy stretching exercises. Whether I'm sitting straight up, bending forward or walking for more than a few minutes each bring on the same symptoms.


An epidural helped but only for about 3 weeks before symptoms returned. This shooting pain is on mind 24/7 because it prevents me from doing most everything. 

I'm looking for suggestions on treating it in the most effective way. 

At this point I've attempted a physiotherapist, years of physical therapy, cortisone shots. Nothing has helped. 

Should I give PRP/Stem Cell Therapy a try or is that a waste of money? Possibly a different procedure??


Should I see a Neurologist or Orthopedic?

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for all your guidance.

39,18 y/o with back pain,"Hey guys, I just found this forum and wanted to share my story and hopefully get some help. 

Since I started weightlifting about 4 years ago, I’ve had lower back pain. This pain gets much worse after working out, especially if the lifts involve tightening of the lower back, but can be affected by workouts like bicep curls. My back begins to feel very tight and sore, and the only way I’ve found I can stretch it out is by reaching down to my legs with my knees bent and putting a lot of emphasis on the lower back. However, the pain is pretty strong when I get back up. 
I’ve had an MRI done which revealed there was nothing wrong with my lower back. I went through 4 weeks of physical therapy which did nothing but make the pain worse. 

I do have tight hamstrings, which they tried to fix in PT but didn’t help. I also have a bad case of flat feet. I bought Dr. Scholl’s foot inserts but they haven’t worked too much. The only time I am without pain is when I stop working out for a good amount of time (a week or more), even if the working out is simply jogging. 

The pain sometimes radiates up to my middle back, but it is completely muscular pain. 

Any insight would be totally appreciated, as I hope there is someone else out there who has gone through this successfully. ",
40,19 Y.O with chronic back pain,"Hey guys,

I've had some back problems for the last 4 years or so.  It's a combination of scoliosis and the work that I used to do (lawn mowing and physical labor).  I've improved my posture, do a bunch of yoga, and that kinda stuff.  Still, I have some really weird issues.  For instance, my left ribs pop whenever I stretch, almost like there's some kind of tissue buildup, and I have a bunch of neck pain when I lay down at night.  I've figured out that the neck pain is directly correlated to my rib issue, AKA if i can temporarily fix my ribs popping with stretching, my neck feels fine afterwards.  In the past, trunk stretches and core rotational exercises have helped, but not nearly as much now.  

​

I've been to a osteopathic doctor about this, as well as massage therapists, acupuncturists, etc. etc.    All seem to help temporarily but not long-term.  Is there any advice anyone could give me?  I know it sounds like voodoo science that my ribs/low back are causing excruciating neck pain (esp when my low back is prone like when I go to bed), but is there anything anyone could recommend to help this?

​

Thanks again!

​

48,Please help. Chronic lower/mid back pain 2 years.,"I am almost 30 years old and have been dealing with ongoing daily back pain for 2+ years now. I apologize for the length but I want to be as detailed as I can.

I believe the injury occurred from lifting bags of cement and rolling a wheelbarrow up and down hill full of it while building a fence. Needless to say a day or so later I was in a lot of pain(lower back/mid back) I went to my regular doctor and was prescribed muscle relaxants and PT. Muscle relaxants didn’t help and I can’t take them at work anyway. The same day I went to my chiropractor and that was the most relief I seemed to get. I swear it felt like a veritbre realigned from being twisted. A good pop and I was better.

I started doing PT for a while afterwards but I still have always had an issue with pain while sitting( particularly while driving). I have tried inversion tables, PT, airrosti, massagers, braves, ect... I still have these issues to this day and it seems to get worse as the day goes on. I also have issues while standing or sleeping ( not as bad) but moving seems to help. I tried running in PT, exercises, stretches, foam rollers and core strengthening. X-ray shows no issues. 

It is almost like my back just gets very tired. I have changed positions at work now to a job where I sit at a desk and drive a lot but still do a lot of walking. Before I was lifting ladders and a hundred pounds on my shoulder a lot and I can do all that it’s mainly the sitting that kills me. I always have to put something behind my lower back to help ( rolled up towel whatever i can find). 

This is starting to drive me insane and I have a very long flight coming up in a couple of months and I am dreading it. I don’t know what to do or try anymore. I am 5’8 150lbs small gut not seriously out of shape or anything. My insurance is not the best but I am starting to say screw it and just fix me. 

What are my next options? Any suggestions would be appreciated. I really wanted to stay away from drugs, shots, and surgery. At this point I don’t know if I care anymore. I just want this to go away. ",

I also get pain when stretching or bending over, although after stretching I get immediate relief that will quickly go away within minutes. Sitting is usually somewhat painful but not overly so. If I keep my back extremely straight while sitting the pain is a lot less noticable.

I’ve purchased his book “Back Mechanic” but I won’t get it for at least a week.

If anyone can point me to an interview with him where he provides recommendations on what to do in the early stages of herniated disc, I would appreciate it.

57,What options do I have left to solve my lower back pain?,"About 7 months ago, I started to have lower back pain while I was sleeping at night.

It doesn't seem to matter whether I'm on by back or side (I tend to be a side-sleeper, but I've tried every position I could to find one that's comfortable). I've done the pillow between the legs thing, the pillow under your legs thing while on your back, etc. I don't believe it's our mattress because I travel a lot and in the past few months have slept on over 30 different beds, all gave me the same back pain.

I went to my doctor and he referred me to physical therapy. They have had me do a variety of stretches and muscle strengthening exercises for my back, ham-strings, hip-flexors, and ham-strings. I've been to five physical therapy appointments over the course of a month and haven't noticed any amount of relief. I've also started going to a chiropractor (who took x-rays that didn't show anything unusual) and have also not seen any relief from that either.

Every night I end up taking 800mg of ibuprofen before bed and two tablets of Tylenol during the night, but the pain still forces me up and out of bed by around 4am. I can usually feel the back pain starting almost immediately after laying down. There wasn't any traumatic event in the past year that could have led to the pain that I'm aware of.

After working with the doctor, physical therapy, the chiropractor, and stretching/exercising, I'm starting to run out of ideas of what to do next. I don't want to just accept that this'll just be the way it is from now on, but I honestly don't know what my next step should be.

59,Need help with girlfriends left side lower backpain! Thank you!!,"Hi! I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit or not but I think you can help me (or atleast hope so!) but to the point:

My girlfriend (20y) has had lower backpain for 2 years now and she is still strugling with it. She is not sure where she got it but she suspects that it might be because her gym-postures weren’t that great maybe? She used to go to the gym 4 times a week but now can’t go because of the pain. She also used to jog a lot but it’s impossible now. She is the type that doesn’t like to go the doctors but somehow I managed to get her to see one. Unfortunately after three visits to three different physioterapist and numerous visits to the chiropractor the situation isn’t helping (and she doesnt have money to visit them just for fun) and she really has lost hope about the situation. It’s very hard/next to impossible to get her try new stretches and excerices and it seems like this is now on my burden so I really need help guys!!

So what type of pain she has? The pain starts on her lower back from the left side right around the round bone and radiates from there. If her back gets irritiated it sometimes radiates to her leg and arm. The chiropractor noticed that her left side is much weaker than her right side so he figured out that maybe the muscle on the left side that goes from aprox the hip to her neck is pulling and is a lot weaker than the same muscle on her right side. Also her neck-area gets easily stuck and she gets headaches basicly because the muscle is pulling so bad. Her lower back bones were actually stuck and didnt get that round but the chiropractor sorted that out and her lower back is moving well now.

When the pain occurs? Well, basicly the pain is with her all the time except it tones down only a bit when she lies down but otherwise it’s there all the time. If she tries to jog the pain is very intense after the jog for days before settling down.

I really need some help with it because life gets harder by the day. I try to keep her as positive as possible but it’s not always as easy. I would be really happy if somebody could help me out and reccomend some exercises (I think they would be the best), maybe stretches or maybe pain relief methods (message etc.). We have tried many exercies but it’s hard to know to which side we need to do them because she doesnt always feel on which side the exercise works on and she gets quite easily frustrated nowadays. If you need more info let me now! It would be really helpful and make our lives like million times more better and worth living if we could resolve this!! Thank you!!

Cheers!!

I have ligament laxity in the thoracic spine, t4-5. At night as I lay down, my back will go out of alignment, which causes pain in the area and mostly at the base of my neck, making it impossible to sleep unless I whack myself out with painkillers. The muscles on the right side of my trapezius get inflamed. Sometimes massage will help loosen the area to the point where my back goes back in alignment. 
I was a heavy weightlifter in my younger days, and I think maybe that is a factor.
My posture could be better, my shoulders slump a bit. I think maybe poor posture is exacerbating the problem.
Because the problem is structural or mechanical, it seems to me that there may be some movements to strengthen those rhomboids or whatever the muscle is.

Most recently a fusion at L5-S1.
Micro discectomy L4-L5 - L5-S1 
Micro discectomy L5-S1

In the gym he has concentrated a lot of my exercises on my arms.
I have been given 2 exercises for my core - planks which honestly I cannot do too much of because they really hurt my back, and crunches. One exercise for my back (back extensions).

I have about 6 or 7 exercises for my arms.

Is this normal? I thought there would be a lot more focus on my core muscles?

72,Hurt my back playing tennis,"Hello everyone,

So earlier today, my friends and I went to play tennis. 
In the middle of the game, as I tried turning my back to hit the ball I got this extremely painful feeling coming from the left side of my back. 
As soon as I felt the pain I had to stop playing. I had to sit down. 
A bit after, one of my friends had to drive me home. (I can’t even drive)
I was wondering if there are any remedies, reliefs, or techniques you guys use to feel better. 

The pain feels like is coming from my ribs. (Left side)

I would say the pain is like a 6.5, I can’t barely move. 
At the moment, I am using icy hot patches. 

Any suggestions will be appreciated. 

Thanks!",

74,Pain gets worse after resting,"Hey folks, I‘m a 22 year old female (normal BMI), struggling with backpain for a few years. I am a writer/journalist/student and sit most of the time. In december I had MRI, doctor said, a disc prolapse could happen in a few years. I had a patellar dislocation in 2012 on my left knee, my backpain is mostly on the right (maybe my „balance“ is wrong?). I try to do more sports, but it doesn‘t really work. Even getting a new matress didn‘t do anything for me, so I just got an appointment for my back doc again. What bothers me the most: Resting doesn‘t help. Has anyone experienced this?

76,Chronic back pain while sitting since 4.5 years. MRI/CT Scans all have been norma,"Age : 26 years

I am having chronic back pain while sitting since the last 4-4.5 years. MRI/Scans have been normal and doctors say there is no structural damages. I have tried PT/exercises but pain relapses as soon as I stop them. 

I even started gymming and I can lift heavy weights, do deadlifts easily without any discomfort. I play Table tennis, Badminton and football regularly without any discomfort.

I only have trouble sitting which is pretty weird considering I am active otherwise. The pain starts in 10-15 minutes. I feel the pain from around lower back to just above my buttocks. I have tried different back rests/sitting cushions etc but nothing works. 

I have a desk job. I have tried sitting/standing desk but I can't even sit for more than an hour without feeling the pain.

Only thing that works for me is a TENS treatment which lasts max for a day",
77,Pain has migrated? Overall inflammatory issue? Allergic to wheat?,"I'm 31 male.  Have been suffering with L3-S1 since age 13. Last week my T3-T4 went out which usually isn't a problem beyond occasional stiffness. It was some of the worst pain I've  experienced in my entire life. I couldn't move or breathe for about a week. I dont think I did anything unusual to injure it... Just as soon as it was feeling a little better for a couple days, now my L3-S1 region has flared up the worse it has in maybe 5 years or more. Its swollen to the touch even. 

The only real changes in my lifestyle is that we went camping and fishing a couple weeks ago, and the hard ground and fishing may have irritated things a little. I didnt feel particularly bad in the morning though. 

 But while we were camping we made a bunch of sandwiches and burgers and stuff. I normally avoid bread and wheat for digestive issues. But I've found myself eating bread and whatever I can find as my digestion has been pretty good lately and there are a lot of dishes I have been missing.  I havent bought a loaf of bread in years but I have been in too much pain to cook my special diet so been eating easy foods since getting back from camping. But I think the wheat may have caused an inflammatory response in my joints? Grasping at straws here,but trying to explain what caused this horrible pain flare up the worst I've had in several years ,maybe ever, and new pain up in my T3-T4 area. 

I'm in bad bad shape. Cant even go to the bathroom without a few tears. And I dont ever cry. I've done cortisone and the standard muscle relaxers and steroid route several times in the past with poor results. only thing that helps is TENS therapy and taking it easy but NO chairs.",

79,Lower back pain when doing sit ups and other ab workouts,"I used to do hundreds of situps every day but at a certain point, something happened and for years now, every time I do sit ups or other ab workouts (ab machine, leg raises, etc.), my lower back gradually goes from a dull pain to an intense pain the more reps I do.

The only ab workout that does not hurt my lower back is when I do sit ups on a fitness ball.

Other than when I do ab workouts, there isn't any lower back pain at all.

I also sit a large part of the day. Not sure if that is part of it.

I've also been to chiropractors and they were basically useless.

86,Huge anxiety after cervical herniated disc diagnosis,"Hi all,

A couple of days ago, I was diagnosed with a small cervical herniated disc at C5, which slightly compresses the thecal sac. I also have a few bulging discs, but according to my doctor they are nothing to worry about. I was recommended Physical Therapy, no medication, and a follow up MRI after 6 months to 1 year.

The thing is, ever since I was a little girl, I’ve also had some health anxiety, which I’ve been managing quite well until now. But when the diagnosis came, my mind immediately went to the most gruesome scenarios, such as paralysis. For this reason, I’ve literally been too afraid to move my neck since leaving the doctor’s office. My symptoms also suddely came back in full force, and I’m hyper-aware of every single feeling in my spine. Because of all this, I can feel the tension in my back muscles increasing.

I guess what I’m looking for is a bit of reassurance, from someone who’s been through something similar, that I’m not going to become paralyzed brushing my teeth and that conservative treatment does indeed work.

Thank you!",

90,Leg discrepancy 1 year good progress,"So maybe a year and a half ago I had insanely bad back pain in my middle and lower back in the form of burning/pins and needles or a stabbing pain which occasionally radiates across the width of my back. I still do have a bit of pain, but the problem, based on spine doctor's suggestions, from a crooked pelvis which makes my legs uneven. The first and biggest thing to reduce the pain was not just heel support (inserts) but also sole support. I experimented until I found something called Even Up (I swear, this is not a promotion lol) which is not actually meant for this purpose but it straps to any shoe and since it worked I figured why the heck not? It probs reduced my pain by 60%

The 2nd biggest thing for the remaining pain, and I know many do not like this route and I am WELL aware of the side effects, is kratom. It's not regulated (for now) in my state and as long as you buy in bulk I can get 2 months for $100 or even $80 for a discount if you use crypto on many sites.

93,Did any of you regain your old mobility? Or at least your old capacity to bend over?,"The question is mostly aimed at those who did [McGill's Big 3](https://i.imgur.com/L8uzmqY.jpg) but if you had success with another method, feel free to share. 

Before injury, I used to be able to bend over and touch the floor like [this.](https://www.thefitindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Standing-Toe-Touch.jpg) This became impossible after my accident. Few months after my injury I found Stuart McGill's interviews on youtube, I bought his book, I learned not to trigger my pain mechanisms, always keep my back straight when lifting etc. 

A year later I'm back pain free, right? Yeah, but only as long as I don't bend over too many times during the day, or I don't break the form. The moment I bend with my back curved I'm back to square one with pain. 

I thought the disc was supposed to ""gristle"" (quote from one of his videos) or 

&gt;""When left alone (and not contorted into unnatural positions such as in yoga) this disc eventually stiffens over time and the pain resolves.""

^that's a quote from Back Mechanic, page 15.

Now during that year, I didn't do McGill's Big 3. I was lazy, I was also sedentary, I didn't move much except when necessary. I didn't have pain so I thought I was fine but apparently not.

97,Back/Nerve Pain In Young Adult,"Age: 21

Male

5'8"" overweight (not obese)

I've had an interesting health journey the last couple of years that has included multiple issues, both back-related and unrelated. First off my back pain started about 4 years ago and was located solely in the lower back; this was the lone medical issue for me outside of illnesses here and there, but in October of 2016 a slew of vague symptoms started to arise. Some have come and gone, but the ones that are still around as of today are IBS, Chronic Gastritis, GERD, Nerve Pain, Bouts of dizziness, Anxiety, Pain in all 3 sections of the spine, etc.

Most recently however some of my back/nerve issues have gotten worse. It started on Wednesday of last week where my shoulder felt odd, not painful or anything, but just an off sensation of some kind. I ended up going out to disc golf that day regardless and while there was some minor pain involved, it didn't affect me while i was playing. Later that night however, I had a bunch of tingling down the right side of my arm and it felt like there was a lack of nerve circulation in my arm. The next few days the pain kind of moved to kind of underneath/inside my shoulder blade, but no longer in the arm itself. And now as of recently the pain is no longer in the shoulder blade but now there's a lot of pain and discomfort in my lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spine. Like I said i've had mild to moderate chronic discomfort in these areas for a while now, but this pain is more acute in nature. The thoracic section is definitely what is the most bothersome currently. I'm having tingling that is going down all 4 limbs. I've been walking a few miles a couple times a day which definitely has helped the last few days as far as pain goes, but the tingling sensation increases during this exercise. Certain positions definitely hurt more than others, i can't sit up in a normal chair for long periods of time without extreme pain.

It's tough for me to gather exactly what's happening (although i have hypothesis) because I've had similar but more mild symptoms that haven't been occuring with a back flare up, like tingling/nerve issues in my arms/lower legs. I don't even sleep on my side anymore because my shoulders go numb and it's extremely painful when i wake up if i end up accidentally rolling over. Back pain and neuropathy go together, but im not sure if the neuropathy is fully caused by the back issues, but maybe just enhanced because of it? I always think i might have Thoracic outlet syndrome which might have contributed to the arm issues prior to the current injury.

I've had some tests done with a rheumatologist and physiologist last year which came out negative for Ankylosing Spondylitis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and a few other things i can't recall at this moment. I also don't have carpal tunnel so as far as impingement in the hands, that's nonexistent. I had an X-ray done that only showed a straightening of the cervical spine, but nothing else out of the normal.

I will be calling my physiologist tomorrow to schedule an appointment, but in the meantime i'm just curious on getting some thoughts from the community who potentially could relate to the situation.

As far as my activity level, i disc golf a few times a week and walk once or twice, but i do end up sitting for long periods of time on the computer or whatever else. My standing posture is great, but sometimes i compensate for the backpain when on the computer and will sit in odd positions. It's definitely something i need to work on.",

99,Science on Somatics by Thomas Hanna,"Hello!

I am currently in treatment by a clinical psychologist who specialices in body therapy.

I have had backpain periodically and now chronically for the last 5 years. I tried exercise, strengthening muscles etc, but that didn't help much.

This is the reason why I think that my issue might be psychological. My x-ray of my spine shows a very mild scoliosis that should not cause any trouble and other than for my backpain I am a perfectly healthy 23 year old. I worry a lot about a multitude of things which I see as part of the issue of why my back and general muscles are tense.

This is why I began seeing a psychologist. This psychologist gave me some exercises and materials based on the somatic therapy by Thomas Hanna, which is scientifically based but not scientifically proven. The basic premise is that you need to retrain your brain(i.e. muscle memory) to let go of the chronically tense muscles which sounds reasonable.

Does anybody have any personal experience with this theory/exercises or maybe is there a scientific study done on this subject that proves that it works?

All these years later, the pain has not gone away. It varies in its intensity, sometimes it only hurts when I bend, and at other times the pain is unrelenting regardless of whether I’m lying down, standing or sitting. When it really flares up I am completely unable to bend at all, and the pain wakes me often at night time. During these periods I understand why people are driven to suicide - it’s that bad. 

I’m fit, mountain bike regularly, I never go to the doctor, and I don’t take any medication. I’m 173cm and 70kg so weight is not a factor. 

I had an X-ray done, my right leg is 9mm longer than my left which throws my pelvis out of alignment, which therefore gives me a slight curve in the spine. I’ve also had an MRI done when it last really flared up, some disc wear is present but nothing too serious. 

I’ve tried:

1. Chiropractic adjustment - sometimes made things worse
2. Massage 
3. Physio
4. Myotherapy

Walking and standing seemed to alleviate the pain.  I tried chiropractic adjustments, massages, and acupuncture and the only thing that helped me pain was the acupuncture.  Before I had my first treatment I could hardly walk, then afterwards I had a huge improvement in pain.  The pain would start in my buttocks and run down my calf like a constant cramp.  While having the pain, and after the acupuncture, I kept playing basketball because it oddly did not make me feel worse.  Though after 2 months the pain was better, it never completely went away.

112,Pain on waking in upper back - could it be the decline bench press?,"Weird thing. Each morning for the past weeks I am waking up a couple of hours earlier than usual and as I do my back feels fine, then slowly a pain emerges almost in a line across my whole back, just under my shoulder blades that makes it impossible to get comfortable. It's like a dull muscle ache and the kind of thing that I have to really work on my posture in bed to manage in order to get back to sleep.

Eventually I can return to sleep, but when I wake up I'm like a creaky old dude, and I'm only 32!

So I was wondering if anyone else has had this, and in trying to find a cause, whether my recent introduction of decline bench into my routine may have caused this? It's an exercise that I don't think I have totally nailed down form wise, something just feels a bit off when I'm doing it.  

Slightly reticent to believe this is the cause because in assuming it's the exercise I might be missing the real cause, and then struggle to find a better treatment, but if anyone has any experience of this,  be great to hear your advice thanks! ",
113,Anybody here have to sleep sitting up?,"So I've had a ""Pars defect"" for almost 15 years, and my pain manifests almost only when I lie flat. Sometimes the pain occurs after long periods of standing up or walking, but the biggest impact has been on sleeping. I can't lie flat on my back, or side or stomach. 

For over 10 years I have been using 5 pillows to build a large comfy wedge, and I sleep in a sitting up position. Throughout the night i slip down to a flat position and have to wake up and setup my pillows again and get into my sitting position again. It sucks, but I've gotten used to it. Recently I've started taking a combo sleeping/ibuprofen pull which has really helped me get better sleep. 

One of the biggest challenges is traveling. Everywhere i go overnight, i travel with my gang of pillows. Flying to Mexico? Suck them into a vacuum bag and sacrifice luggage space. I can only sleep in decent beds with sturdy flat headboards or walls, because i need to stack my pillows against them. No tents, no couches.

Anyways, just wondering if there are any other poor suckers like me out there who might want to trade advice about how they manage life as a sit sleeper? ",

I'm 5'8"", shortish legs.

Would this possibly be a solid choice for me? I've sat in the store, and it seems comfortable, but that's for five minutes. Would really like to be able to sit again, work and hobbies both are generally done sitting and I don't have much of any budget to get something even remotely fancy.",
117,"Mid and lower back pain, how can i stretch for for it?","Hello folks. A simple question for you but a small amount of story first. I'm 27 and have had backpain that has increased over time for a few years now. 
It's not debilitating but I can see it going that way in a few more years. We're talking a chronic ache in the middle of my back, after walking or swimming for long periods of time. This ache also will kick in if I sit up straight for more than 5 minutes. Accompanying this is a real sharp lower back pain that freezes me to the spot for a few seconds when I begin to do something, lifting weights/boxes (pretty much anything that puts strain on my lower back  when my hips are acting as a fulcrum). I understand the kenetic chain and always lift with good form and always warm up befor lifting. I also damaged my knee after one to many pints and have a damaged LTC that has subvertly (sneaky bastard) threw out my kenetic alignment through my hips. 
Could this be the sole reason for the back pain? 
A physio would be a good idea but at this point im kinda' skint. I will get some good physio time in when I have the cash available but for right now my question is 'are there any stretchers, beyond the classic cat stretch or child's pose, that will help ease the ach and help my posture. Something I could do daily?' 

Anything you folks can think of would be greatly apprishiated.

126,L5-S1 Hemilaminotomy and Facetectomy,"Hello!

Due to an injury I've sustained a few years ago, I've had lower back pain that sometimes shoots down to my leg. I have a previous post that goes into a lot more detail if you're willing to read it. 

Basically, doctors have had a hard time figuring out exactly what's wrong with me which leads to a lot of process of elimination of procedures. As in, ""Let's try this procedure, if it doesn't work, it's not what I think it is, and probably something else"" No one has been able to diagnose exactly what is causing my pain.

The latest doctor thinks it could be facet arthropathy caused by the injury I sustained a few years ago. To treat this, he suggested a L5-S1 hemilaminotomy and facetectomy. I've done some research online, but I figured other people's experience or comments would be valuable to learn.

So, if anyone has any experience with facet arthropathy or an L5-S1 hemilaminotomy and facetectomy, I'd love to hear it, seriously I would. ",

128,Pain from Impact,"Hi All,

So on Tuesday (4 days ago) I doing a BJJ practice and fell off of someones back onto an upturned heel. My left lower back absorbed most of the impact. 

As someone with a decent pain tolerance who has been banged up a few times, I am worried. There is a heel shaped bruise in my lower back that hurts when i do squatting or bending over motions. On top of that, my hip gets very painful as well. 

I went to a GP on Thursday and she said she wasn't worried about spinal, kidney, or neurological damage, but the amount of pain still present makes me second guess her. Also, I've noticed that applying pressure to my hip or lower back when doing the painful motions significantly reduces the pain. 

Am I just overreacting? I would say my pain is a little better than the day of the injury, but if this was just a bad bruise I would expect recovery to be pretty quick. I feel no pain from pressing on the spot of impact, just from doing the movements. Am I right to think that pressing on a spinal injury would be excruciating?

Sorry for the rambly nature of the post. I am just trying to accept the good news my GP gave me and get my mind back on recovery.

Thanks!",
129,Acute lower back pain (my back went out),"Yesterday, I woke up, sprang out of bed excited for the day, and picked up my dog. Everything was fine until I went to set her down. As I was setting her down I had an extreme pain in my lower back. Day ruined. 

This is the second time this has happened in the past year and I knew I’d be down and out for about 3 days recovering. Yesterday I spent all day on the floor. I couldn’t move and it hurt to breath. When it was time to get to my bed, I couldn’t get up. I could barely make it to my knees without yelling in agonizing pain. My brother had to come help me up. Helped me to the bathroom. Then helped me to bed. This was way worse than the first time it had happened to the point where I was questioning an ER visit (I’m glad I didn’t or I’d be $4000+ in debt for some short term relief and someone telling me to stretch...)

I ended up sleeping fine once I slept on my stomach with 2 pillows under my hips/stomach. Today I woke up, hung out in bed, then after about an hour of small stretching I went and got some ice. I’m still limping but it’s 10 times better than yesterday. To not feel completely useless I ended up slowly cleaning whatever I could around the house. 

I know my back will get back to normal in a week or two but this whole scenario made me realize how important core strength is. I will be dedicating a lot more of my time to strengthening my back because god forbid this happens when I’m 50... (I’m 26).

Furthermore, I got x-rays done and the doctor found nothing wrong. However, there obviously is, and it's made very little (if any) progress in healing since the day of my injury.

140,Piriformis syndrome has been a huge pain the butt and back! What can I do differently?,"My stats:

31 year old male, 5'9"", 180lbs. , i do not smoke or use drugs, I have not had an injury I can recall to have lead to my condition, and I don't take any medications (outside of ibuprofen).

My story:

For the last year I have been dealing with ""low back pain."" I put it in quotes because, after a year of yoga and activities directed at improving my back health, I was still suffering from the same pain. So I got an Xray and MRI. Both came back negative for any noticeable back issues. After studying more of my symptoms, It seems that I am most likely suffering from Piriformis Syndrom. So the plus side is, my back seems to be okay, and the pain is caused from a muscle in my butt (not a slipped disc). The down side is, I can't get rid of the pain.

This week my doctor ordered physical therapy, and it's still in the early stages, we haven't set a date or started. For the last 5-6 weeks I've been incorporating more yoga, more exercise, and more activities focused on stretching and strengthing my piriformis. And a few things have happened:

Positive:

 1. My sciatica has seemed to really improve. Less leg pain.

 2. My overall health and flexibility has improved. I feel better over all. And all pain really does seem to subside when I am more active and stretch.

 3. Since focusing on stretching and strengthening my piriformis, I have not had any back spasms (I would normally get them ever 4-6 weeks).

Negative:

 1. My butt hurts more than before when sitting. Anytime I sit (or lay on a hard surface) for more than 5min, my piriformis aches and burns, increasing with pain the longer I sit.

So it seems my routine has improved much of my overall fitness, but done little to improve my piriformis pain when sitting. Possibly even made it worse in some way?

Here is my current routine:

 • ~30min of yoga a day (variety of stretches, most focus on low body and back)

 • work out with weights and cardio three time per week. Standard upper and low body stuff.

 • Specific Piriformis stretches and exercises 2 to 3 times per day (stretching and activity makes it feel better, until I sit down).

 • I have also started incorporating the use of a foam roller and lacrosse ball in the last two days (no known positive or negative yet, since I just started).

I guess my main questions and concerns are:

 1. Is my routine only making things worse? Is it possible I am over stretching? If so, what changes should I make?

 2. Is this just all part of the healing process? Is it normal for things to feel more agitated while it heals and improves?

 3. Should I be incorporating more ice and heat on a regular bassis? 

 4. I try and not use ibuprofen, and when I do, it takes 600-800mg at a time to have any impact on the pain. Should I take it more regular to help control the inflammation?

 5. What else can I do to help the healing? Has anyone who has delt with this before, had any luck healing?

I am really hoping my physical therapy helps guide me into a better direction and maybe identifies issues.

In the mean time, thanks guys, I hope there is a change I can make to see improvement.

Edit: other measures I have taken which may or may not have a positive impact include:

- I have a standing desk which I use a lot. And a standing pad.
- I have a yoga ball I try and sit on while watching tv at home (doesn't help with butt pain much)
- I drive a lot for work, so I use my seat heater which definitely helps with pain. I try and stop and stretch every hour. And I use a lumbar support.
- I take quite a few vitamins and supplements like multi, turmeric, Berberine, ginger, and osteo biflex.

141,Advice needed on how to sleep with lower back pain.,"I had a herniated disc in the past and now 10 yrs later I am having similar symptoms started PT this week, but I cannot get a MRI until I do a couple days of physical therapy (insurance I guess) .

142,Mystery Injury,"(This happened when I was 19, and no one seems to take it seriously. I tried PT and it didn't help.)

I am a chronic procrastinator. So, the night before we had to be out of the dorms, I was hurriedly carrying all of my stuff down 3 flights of stairs (and doing laundry) out to the parking lot to put in my car. On one of the trips, I was carrying my fire-proof safe which was pretty heavy but I was pushing to get done on my own and didn't think it was a big deal.

It felt like a rubberband snapped in my lower back. My legs gave out and I collapsed. I tried to move my legs to get up, but I couldn't. I'll admit, I panicked. It was like 3am, I didn't have anyone to call for help (my dad was flying in the next day to help drive across the country to home), and I was alone in the parking lot unable to move.

After what felt like a excessively long time, I managed to move my legs and shakily get to my feet.

Since then my back hurts pretty much all the time. Last night it felt like a band of stabbing pain draped across my lower back any time I moved, and this morning it's slightly better (more achy, and mostly if I twist or bend over). ~~I'm also really nauseous but I don't think that's related?~~

Anyone know what this could be, or where I should have doctors start looking? (I probably need to go to Urgent Care because the ibuprofen I took is only helping a little. My back still feels weird, like it could give out again at any time.) ",

144,Lower back injury is driving me crazy! Muscular or disc-related? Treatment recommendations? PLEASE HELP!,"I (25F) have chronic back pain that started February 2018 after hurting my back doing a sport. I had hurt it previously a few times the year before, but not nearly as bad. This time, it was horrible - could barely walk for a 1-2 weeks after it happened. I did 6 weeks of physical therapy and it slowly got better.  

Since February, whenever I do simple things such as walking for too long, riding my bike, -having sex even!- my back hurts during or afterwards. The pain is mostly concentrated on one side, but there is pain all along my lower back, near my sacrum. The pain radiates through my hips and feels like a constant burn. Sometimes if I sit in a certain position (like when driving), pain shoots down the side of my quad (the side that hurts more). 

I’ve been to see doctors, and just got an x-ray yesterday. Normal x-ray results. I am curious about getting an MRI, but the doctor I saw at the urgent care center said that ‘they probably won’t find anything because it’s probably muscular.’ How can I tell if it’s a disc problem or truly muscular? I’ve pulled muscles in my lower back before, but this pain feels very different. Something is seriously wrong. 

I feel like I’m going crazy because I can’t do simple things I once did with ease. I love sports, and am dying to go out for a run, play soccer, etc. without hurting. Some people want me to quit all sports/activities until I’m fully healed. How long does it take something like this to heal? Will it ever heal? I feel like I’m at the end of my rope here. The pain just keeps coming back! Also, it’s depressing to be a 25 year old with back problems.

145,Chronic Lower Back Pain/Difficulty Walking,"I'm a 27/M, 5'11.5'', 175 pounds, fairly fit and active. But I've worked a full-time desk-job where I am primarily sitting for 12 hours a day for 8 years now, and also have a 1.5-2 hour commute in my manual vehicle each day that I work. This alone has caused some minor back pain in the past that always resolved on its own. At the beginning of this year I also began lifting weights and on one particular set of deadlifts I believe I really exacerbated my underlying back issues with bad form. That's when things really got worse.

At first I thought this was simply sciatica because I would have sharp pains in my buttocks, but with a light stretching routine this also resolved. Now I've been stuck with this chronic lower back pain that continues to impede my left leg from being raised without causing a lot of pain. At this point I believe it isn't muscular, but perhaps L-spine compression or another such MSK injury, although I don't have a formal diagnosis. Stretching is painful and the back pain even impacts how much I can push when using the washroom. I've been using OTC medications just to help me walk normally, but I still limp a little bit even with a tyelnol/advil combo. This has been going on for a few months now.

I’m so glad to know this sub exists. I’ve been dealing with lower back pain since an ultimate frisbee injury (feel free to tee off with funny comments on that factoid) since I was 19. Recently though, my problem officially moved from the biannual serious bout with muscle spasms to an MRI confirmed herniated L4/L5. So my life since February has been chronic pain in my low back and the associated peripheral nueropathy in my hips, legs, and feet.

It terrifies me to think that I won’t be able to be active and play with my daughter (2 y/o) like I want to be able to, or not be able to help my wife with a second child and someday play catch with that second kid. It makes me wonder if it’s irresponsible to have more children. As you can imagine, those thoughts leave me quite depressed.

My father has had 4 (maybe even five now) spinal surgeries and multiple vertebrae fused. But he had those all done when I was much older then my daughter is, and I still have those memories of playing sports or doing other physical activities with dad.

Has anyone had this issue with associated depression?",

148,Anyone with cervical issues have problems with your chest muscles never relaxing?,"So I compression fractured C3 and C4 when I was 17 playing foolsball. I was in a brace for 8 months that went from my pelvis to holding my head and chin in place because it also caused swelling up my entire spine. I’ve had brief sessions of physical therapy, I’ve seen plenty of doctors who have no time to talk to a 27 year old about back pain (literally had a physical therapist tell me I was too young for arthritis except I have arthritis), and my issues just seem to be getting weirder and weirder. I have face palsy most days, burning sensations in my right foot, tingling/hot sensations down my left arm, if I look to the right for longer than 5 seconds it just starts to feel like I have someone poking me with the tip of a knife in the small of my back. Sometimes I get a stabbing sensation in my upper middle back that has brought me to the ground before.

The weirdest thing though is that my chest muscles never seem to relax. It feels like my pectorals are a tight cord at all times. I stretch multiple times a day including a few different neck exercises I was given by physical therapist.  I work out regularly and I maintain a good posture. I’m just wondering if others have the problems with the chest muscles. I feel like that issue is what keeps me from sleeping the most because it doesn’t seem to let me relax my shoulders when i sleep either. On average I sleep for 4.5 hours and then after that it’s just tossing and turning. Anyone?",
149,Broken Tailbone,I fell and broke my tailbone last August.  The pain wasn't very bad at the time but over time the pain has gotten worse.   In the last 3 months the pain has gotten unbearable.  I can set down no problem and touching the tailbone doesn't hurt.  If I walk and walk 3-5 minutes I get lots of pain where my spine connects to my pelvis down toward the tailbone.  It burns and my left leg wants to drag.  If I sit down for 2-3 minutes I am good for 5 more minutes and then it repeats.  I have a dr appointment but not sure what the problem could be.  I am afraid they will say it is muscle pain from where the tailbone was broken but the pain is getting worse and only happens when I walk.  Sitting is no problem.,

I have been to Doctors, physiotherapy, one chiropractor (seemed like he just wanted my money) and a massage therapist.

I have had an MRI on my back that came back with no problems although I have had people comment on my back that there seems to be a protrusion in my spinal disks in the area marked by Picture 5.

I experience a tightening pain in the areas that I have highlighted in black, and I have found that if I crack my back in the area shown in picture 1 that I get some temporary relief, before the pain comes back.

Initially the massage therapist said that I had very tight muscles in my back and warned me not to go to the gym while she was doing her work, but although it felt slightly better it did not solve the problem entirely (even when she said that the muscles were no longer tight).

Any help that you can provide for me would be fantastic because i feel like my back pain is stopping me from doing things i want to do and can get me depressed.

155,Back Pain and Mood?,"I’m so glad to know this sub exists. I’ve been dealing with lower back pain since an ultimate frisbee injury (feel free to tee off with funny comments on that factoid) since I was 19. Recently though, my problem officially moved from the biannual serious bout with muscle spasms to an MRI confirmed herniated L4/L5. So my life since February has been chronic pain in my low back and the associated peripheral nueropathy in my hips, legs, and feet. I’ve been through opiates, muscle relaxers/anticonvulsants, physical therapy, and now I’m through the first leg of a three epidural treatment plan. The epidural round makes it sound like three strikes and you’re out, with out being back surgery.

158,Lower backpain during squats,"About a week ago, maybe a bit more, I noticed that my lower back hurts in some positions. I thought nothing of it, maybe just overworked a muscle and it is a bit stiff as it wasn't any specific move/exercise that I did that would cause my injury..I put warm pad on and drink some mg thinking it would relieve the muscle. But it didn't help. Now I don't even know anymore if the pain is in the muscle or somewhere else, but to be clear, I only feel pain in my back, not in my butt/leg. The pain is most noticeable when I squat really low or when I am sitting and lift my (straight) leg up/rotate it in the air (so when I stretch out my hamstrings and bulge my back basically). Pain isn't constant, it lessens with every lift of the leg I do (first time it's kind of sharp pain). I worked out the other day and felt pretty good and said to myself that I would try to squat. I didn't put that much weight on the bar. On the way down it was ok, but as soon I reached the low point and started to push up it hurt so I stopped right away. I am going to see a doctor but I need to wait in line until next monday, so any help would be nice :)",

161,Is my mattress the problem?,"Hello all!

Since november 2017 I have been experiencing back pain. Mainly lower back. 

I had been lifting boxes for 14 months, always between 7000 and 13000kg a day.

However i changed mattress somewhere in august or early september.

I went to see a physiotherapist and he told me my back felt like concrete. It did help what he did. This was right after I quitted that shitty heavy lifting job.

4 weeks later I started at another company, had to bind pallets together, so ducking and pulling 2-300 pallets a day. Did that for a month and then I upgraded to forklift. Obviously, sitting in that thing hurted my back after the first hours, so 7 hours pain. 

Now I am 4 months further, not working, still the same pain. 

The only thing that changed is my mattress from a firmer to a soft one. My waist is like sinking in a bit in the mattress while my upperbody is in a more upright position🤔

Did took an mri scan but that lady said she doesn’t see anything bad. 

Should I buy a new mattress or ?",
162,im so sorry,For the first time in my life I pulled my back lifting a friend drunk. It was honestly one of the worst pains of my life the next day I was even in pain breathing. After going to the er the doc said I probably just pulled it and to take some meds for the these days and should be fine. 3 days later I’m honestly blown how much better I’m feeling but I just could not help but feel sorry for those suffering.. Jesus I remember reading people talking about suicide from this and thinking they were exaggerating.. nope you just never had back pain if that sentence doesn’t make sense ( I’m drunk again but I just wanted to let you guys know dam man..),
163,Back aching 6 months after discectomy / Facet injection/?,"I had a right side L5/S1 disectomy 6 months ago. I've been doing physical therapy since the operation.


My nerve pain has 99% gone. It only flares up if I regularly sit for hours.

(I have a standing desk at work so can swap between sitting/standing)


However my lower back is stiff and frequently aches. This tends to go away after a 10-20 minute walk and so mobilizing it is great though if I overdo it then it may swell up for a few days and I'll get a bit of nerve pain till it subsides.


Has anyone has experienced this? Does it last or does it go away once you've strengthened your back again?


My surgeon has said he can do a facet joint injection which is not uncommon for people to have after a discectomy. Has anyone had one of these?

166,"currently stuck on the floor for 18 hours, advice needed","I’m a 30 year old female, generally healthy. Back in college I injured myself lifting a bookcase, went and got an MRI (2010?) and it showed I have a couple bulging discs, L4-L5 I think. I got some epidurals, went through some physical therapy, and eventually felt back to normal for the most part. Since then, I would say maybe once or twice a year I move wrong and tweak my back, sending it into serious pain but it usually only lasts a week and it has never been completely debilitating... until now.

Last night I was reaching to open my reptile’s tank, and my lower back completely gave out, it started spasming, and I fell to the ground. I was stuck in an extremely tight, specific position for about 2 hours. Eventually I was able to bend/extend my knees but still couldn’t turn over onto my side, let alone attempt to get up. My boyfriend brought me blankets and water and I slept on the living room floor. 

This morning I called into work. At about hour 14 on the floor I had to use the bathroom so bad that I spent about an hour working my way over to a couch I could use as leverage to get myself to stand up and walk to the bathroom. I made it but ended up puking because of the amount of pain I had allowed (glad I didn’t pass out). Now I’m back on the floor and just kind of weighing my options...

My boyfriend is a wildland firefighter here in CA and he’s out fighting a fire right now, no idea when he’ll back. I don’t want to pay for an ambulance. I don’t see myself being able to climb down stairs or sit in a friend’s car to urgent care for another day or two but not sure (this is the worst it’s ever been so this is new territory for me)? 

Typically with my back pain, when it gets re-inflamed, I try to move around a lot to keep it loose, but this time feels different. Almost like my body is telling me no. Should I just be staying still or do I continue to try and move through the pain? It would be nice to be able to get up and get ice and food on my own. After a battle with pain meds from my first injury, I’m at a place where I’d refuse narcotics but I do have neighbors supposedly coming over later with good anti-inflammatories. Once all this is over and I’m able to go back to work, I’m obviously going to need to get an updated MRI but until then...

Any advice, suggestions? How long does it take the body to get out of this weird, locked up state? Has it ever taken anyone more than 48 hours? And if I give in and go to the ER, is there anything they can do for me that’s better than just waiting it out on my own?

Thanks so much in advance, any input is appreciated!",
167,Exercise vs Surgery,"I've been seeing physical therapists for years and it my back pain has improved, but I still have a lot of issues. I worry a lot about my future and I'm wondering what that looks like.

I have arthritis and bulging discs in my L4/5 and L3/4 \- my understanding is that through exercise and PT I'll be able to strengthen my core to support my back and it'll relieve my back pain. 

How likely is this? I mean, is strengthening my core really going to allow the disc to not be under pressure? 

I'm sure that other people are in similar frustrating situations. I'm tired of living this ""half life"" where I can do some things, but not others and where I'm in constant pain. I used to be fit and active and now I can't even walk for more than a mile or two without intense recuperation. I've gained about 50 lbs because I had to stop running and now I'm way overweight which adds to the pressure on my spine.

Thoughts?",

169,"""Too Young"" for my Back Problems","I'm 28. Everyone who hears about my back problems will first tell me I'm way too young before suggesting 8 or 9 things I've already tried that don't work before then leaping to the conclusion that I must be doing something wrong or not have been doing it enough. I've paid too much money, wasted too much time, and listened to WAY too much bullshit for 3 years to put up with this any longer. This is a plea to anyone with new advice or ANYTHING that has actually helped with similar problems. Please don't suggest something that hasn't yet worked for you, personally.

Symptoms:

Dull lower back pain between a 7 and an 8 at all hours of the day, worst in the morning when I get out of bed and when I am seated at work for longer than an hour. I work in a job where I have to sit much of the time, even with my standing desk \(standing all the time is bad for your back too\). I sit a lot when I get home because all of my personal passions are seated activities \(drawing, video games, writing, radio broadcasting\). The area it hurts in is larger the longer I sit. It almost always hurts in an egg shape around my lumbar region. Spine doctors and physical therapists alike look befuddled when I say this. As it gets worse, it first spreads to my buttocks. At the absolute worst it shoots down my legs, though usually just on one side. I have reasonably good posture according to a physical therapist. I was an avid runner for a long time, able to run 5 and 10ks for fun. Three years ago, I started full time at my job. That's when the pain started to spiral out of control.

What I have tried:

New mattress

New computer chair

Standing desk

Foam rolling exercises \(more pain\)

Resistance band exercises

Pilates \(no clue if I even have the right muscle control, no tutorials even make sense\)

Yoga \(more pain\)

Core strengthening exercises \(more pain\)

Swimming

Jogging

Hiking

Using an elliptical

Weightlifting

Stretching \(VERY painful\)

Squats \(more pain\)

Physical therapy exercises \(prescribed core/ab strengthening exercises and thigh/hip exercises

Advil \(Rapidly waning effect\)

Aleve \(No effect\)

Meloxicam \(No effect\)

Baclofen \(Worked once, no longer affects me, even at an increased dosage\)

Psychotherapy

Heat/ice therapy

Massage therapy \(felt worse after somehow???\)

Massage chairs

Manual back massagers

Acupuncture \(total scam\)

""Herbal medicine""

Anti\-inflammatory diet \(helped with other aspects of my health but not the back pain\)

Bengay

Mindfulness \(made me deeply uncomfortable, restless, and angry\)

Lower back muscle\-specific exercises \(one of the last things suggested to me, feels like it should have been mentioned a lot sooner, and yet, also doesn't help\).

I imagine none of this is unique.",
170,Back injury from twist and lift...what happened?,"So I was in an odd position and attempted to lift a box around 30 pounds or so while twisting my back. Because this happened at work and due to the incompetence of the doctor I saw (just an urgent care doctor) I really have no idea whether this is just a muscle strain or a herniated disc, etc. and probably can't get diagnostic images taken unless I wait and do it under my regular insurance. The pain was acute and very severe and is still persisting 4 days later. Muscle relaxers aren't really helping at all. My left leg is in some pain but most of the pain is generally only felt with movement, such as standing up from sitting and bending down. But still quite severe. What is the most likely cause?",
171,Deadlift injury that won't heal completely,"So in April I injured myself while deadlifting, it was nothing serious so I just rested for some time but the back didn't heal completely. Then I pulled my back once again (not while training) and decided to see a specialist. He told me nothing was wrong and that I just needed some rest and doing one exercise (The common ab-stretch where you lie on your stomach and push your back upwards with your hips grounded). Then again the pain was almost completely gone but I still had some discomfort. 

4 weeks ago I pulled my back again but this time I followed his tips and the pain was gone in 2 days but ever since then I have still had this lingering discomfort that gets better during the day but just won't disappear completely. I still workout but avoid exercises that are heavy on the lower back. 

Is this normal and will disappear or should I try some exercises/stretching to recover completely? I have no problems moving but sitting and bending for longer periods results in some discomfort. 

Thanks in advance and hopefully I explained it clearly.",
172,Lower back pain / right shoulder pain that stops when I press my lower back against the chair's arm rest. Why?,"Hi guys,

I have had for years (15?) pain in my right shoulder. I think I got this when swimming when I was younger. It has all the symptoms of a rotator cuff injury. I went to the doctors and did X-ray and MRI but they tell me there doesn't seem to be anything too wrong with my right shoulder. Depending on some factors, the pain can happen in my shoulder or anywhere in my right shoulder / upper back. The pain of course gets a lot worse after doing weight lifting, especially with training that involves raising my right arm.

I've recently noticed that leaning my back against my chair's arm (a hard surface) hard makes the pain immediately vanish. At first I thought it was just about ""helping"" my back acquire a good posture /  finally giving some rest to my back's muscles but now I'm leaning towards another possible explanation -- what if by doing this blocking some nerve that's responsible for the pain in my upper back?

Could anyone shed some light in this? I have almost no flexibility in my lower back (I'm light years away of being able to touch my toes with my hands, for instance), and very frequently, if I'm not careful when picking stuff from the ground, I get pain in my lower back for a couple of days.

Thanks",

I guess I just wanted to ask you guys with back pain if they ever experience this crazy tingling/pins and needles feeling in the back of your head. Anybody? It drives me nuts and will last more than a week sometimes. I have other nerve issues too, but the tingling on my head is CRAZY and really makes me not want to do anything. I'm reading through Google right now, but I do that all the time and it usually just makes me nervous. Haha. Does anyone here have this happen to them? If so, have you been able to stop it or talked to a doctor about it? Like I said, I have the nerve conduction study coming up this month.. I was looking for anyone else with the same issue to talk to, I guess. I'm thinking if I talk to more people a light bulb could go on for me and it might help me talk to this specialist I'm going to see.

176,"Increasingly bad back pain for over a year, I cant find any form of pain relief and I think the issue may not be my back but a symptom of something else.","tl;dr bad back pain, I think I was misdiagnosed for possible kidney disease or endometriosis and im scared my mri will turn up with nothing and ill be back to square 1.

If it helps I'm 24f 5'2 and my weight is between 95-105 pounds. Generally I was a very active person before the pain got to bad, to my knowledge I have not injured anything.

My chronic lower backpain started a year ago. I had some things ruled out but im scared they were really just over looked. I had appendicitis while in the hospital overnight i peed like 10 to 15 times and when i go its a very little amount but I have to do it my bladders not full but its to much pressure for me and it hurts and they told me It wasnt normal to pee so much but I told them that it was normal for me I pee that much every night at home so they did a quick ultrasound but said everything looked okay. After recovery I saw my doctor about the back pain to get it taken care of and mentioned my frequent bathroom trips at night. The pain intensified durind my periods and was always getting worse and lasting longer so they suggested seeing an obgyn for endometriosis. The obgyn did an internal ultarsound and said they didnt see anything weird in the ultrasound and were able to look at my organs and they looked fine. I went back to the doctor for birth control to have the pain managed during my period and had to do a pregnancy test, my urine sample came back funky and they asked me more specifically about my pain. My pain specifically is in my lower spine it starts around the lower portion of my ribs and runs down but its more on the right side, its in my pelvis and sometimes the front of the bottom of my lower ribs but it feels like its underneath it and my actual side, its a dull ache all day that goes to sudden sharp spasms or stabbing pain. I have a family history of kidney disease so they had me come in for a couple more times over the month to do blood and urine tests and then they said I was fine it was probably just one off test that day and my tests were back in normal ranges and that was that. 

I have a new primary care doctor, I just got checked up for my back 2 or 3 weeks ago and told her everything and she informed me you can only be positively diagnosed with endometriosis surgically because an ultrasound cant really see endometriosis tissue. The pain has significantly gotten worse lately. Ive had an xray and the technichian said something about my joints not wanting to open up while taking the side view of the xray and they had to retake the xray mutiple times. My mri is Friday and I'm petrified that they're not even going to find anything wrong and I have this pain for no reason at all. 

My life has been so badly affected by this to the point I just dont want to exist anymore. The past 4 months my body has declined and I feel really useless and terrible and embaressed I dont even want to leave my house. I physically can not bend over and recently the pain from my spine has caused me to start peeing myself a little when im just walking up and down my stairs, jumping, coughing or sneezing and i have allergiers right now so thats just great. I dont even know how to explain it, its just like pressure on my spine and the pain is to intense at some unexpected moments i loose control for a second. Ive looked up online that incontinence can be associated with low back pain but has anyone really ever had that happen to them? And what was your cause of your back pain associated to that? 

I have tried advil,ibuprofen, bayer back and body daily and when they all showed no signs of relief it wasnt worth taking anymore. Ive tried norco which just distracted me a little from the pain but i knew it was still there, i do heat pads and ice, essential oils, special pillows/sleeping positions, stretching and yoga, salt baths and icy hot. I went to a pet shop to hold kittens and it made me forget about it for a little bit and feel better lol anyways my doctor has me on 1 to 2 diazepam every 4 to 8 hours if needed and that also isnt helping at all. 

The incontenince has gotten worse really just the past week with my allergies so I dont want to even leave my house, if I do i have to be careful and be prepared and im embarrassed to even have to bring this up at physical therapy to someones face, which is holding me back from scheduling my appointment. I really just needed to get alot of this off my chest. Im really really scared something is actually wrong with my kidneys and it has nothing to do with my back but im hoping someone else has had some back problem thats caused the same issue and it turned out to be something minor and im freaking out over nothing.",

178,Have any of you got experience with CES?,"TL;DR: CES and leaky butthole. Pls halp. 

Hi all. I'm 8 days post surgery. I had been struggling with a herniated disc for some time and was planning surgery end of summer/early fall to give me time to onboard a fill-in at work and lose some more weight. 

It became an emergency last Sunday, May 20th, when I went numb below the waist after a fall. I was told by the ER to suck it up and talk to my neurosurgeon Monday. He diagnosed me immediately with Cauda Equina Syndrome, and sent me to the hospital for an emergency discectomy. I was released home Friday. 

I still can't feel my feet, calves, hamstrings, glutes, nor any of my private parts. I'm wondering if anyone else here had this with CES, and how long it took to regain feeling and control, if any. Right now I have a Foley catheter in and every time I sit on the toilet I leak poo since I can't control my butthole. I regularly sit on the toilet for 1-2 hours and still can't get clean, and it's driving me crazy.

First time posting on this sub but a long time lurker. So I had an MRI back in December of 2017 and the findings were, a L4-5 Posterior Central Bulge. Some other details are included below.

+Canal and neuroforamina are patent.

+L5-S1: Extruded broad-based central, left paracentral disc herniation with caudal migration of disc material without sequestration. The herniation posteriorly displaces and impinges the traversing left S1 nerve root.

+T12-L1 through L3-4 disc levels are normal. Conus terminates at L1 without signal abnormality. No intradural mass lesion.

+Vertebral alignment is anatomic. No vertebral marrow edema, infiltrative marrow process, fracture, anterolisthesis, intraosseous lesion or facet arthrosis. Paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.


Since them my sciatic pain has gone down to almost nothing but now I have pain in my middle back of my spine. I have been super fragile about everything and have strengthened my core a lot, sleeping habits, eating habits, and bending habits.

Is it possible that the disc material is traveling up my spine? I just got blood work done last week and it was normal. I am going to see a new orthopedic this week also.

I have no clue whats going on with me, it sucks and I'm tired. Any suggestions, advice, or experiences would be greatly appreciated. Would love to hear anything. Thanks for taking the time to read my post.

EDIT: I don't know why I can't make bullet point in the post, I tried the formatting help on reddit and it's not working. Plus signs will have to do.",

Last year I bought a pair of lace-up cowboy boots (Ariat Heritage Lacer). The elevated heel takes tension off my hamstrings and makes a *huge* difference. It doesn’t fix my problems by any means, but it allows me to walk much further without pain. Maybe this can help some of you as well. ",

188,I need a bit of advice! L4-L5-S1 hernias,"Hi guys, first time poster here, first time I've ever been here.

Today I came back from my doctor's from some back pain and radiating pain to my left leg, with the diagnosis being herniated discs that are causing my pain and al the ""cracking"" sound I feel sometimes as I twist my back.

Some information about my build: 31y/o, Male, 2.02mts tall, 67Kg, I'm on the light side of the scale, but I exercise regularly, so I'm 0% fat, just sweet muscle and bone. Yes, I'm pretty thin, but at the sme time super strong, like I can lift a washing machine all by myself and carry it around.

Always have been the ""if it doesn't need stitches, then no medic"" kind of guy, always braving stuff up. I have had the worst migraines since I was 12, plus I've got some mental condition that basically sometimes replaces my rational thinking.

I am the go-to guy for physical projects, but am also an architect so I spend a lot of time sitting be it on my computer or my drawing desk, again this information is important.

Me, being the tall guy in a country where the average height is 1,70M and 1,65F, and growing a lot in my teens, and working with people and being a sociable asshat, always had bad posture, which made me gain the Scoliosis perk. /s So I'm super used to feeling pain all the time and just ""meh"" it out, it's just another stupid day in this broken hardware.

A year back, I was working with my best friend ever on a business venture, making some high-end furniture, and designing a couple projects. All well, until he bought an outdoor springboard. We loved that crap. I loved it, just light up a joint and carelessly jump that dreaded white page sindrome away, it was a nice thinking device for me to unblock my thoughts and sometimes get inspired.

I was jumping and my mate's girl did something where you jump standing, fall sitting and then stand up, IDK if I'm describing this well enough. I was amazed by how it looked, and tried to copy her.

I landed sitting and immediatly felt something in my back broke, I could not stop laughing (that's one of my responses to extreme pain, this was like a 8/10 At the moment) and was crippled for like three hours where I could not stand up straight.

The next day the pain was gone so I brushed it off.

In March, this year, I began feeling some absurd pain on my left leg, a pain that went from my heel, through all my leg, my pelvis, my back, a shoulder and my neck. Like if I moved my neck in some way, I could ""feel like something inside is pulling from my neck to my heel"". Kept brushing it off until one day I could not get out of my bed, that was when I called for an appointment, I never thought it could turn out ""bad"" just a muscle spasm, or something stupid right? Nope, it's what I told you at the start, three stupid herniated discs.

I was asked if by chance I had some bowel issues loss of strength on my leg and loss of feeling in my thighs, all of them where answered positive, I've never related something I thought of as IBS, but it began when my leg started to fail.

The doctor ordered some more x-rays, and told me nothing apart from ""it could be worrying, let's wait for the imaging""

I'm freaking out.

Can someone with more experience in this field, maybe get my hopes high or tell me to prepare for a painful existence now on?

Hell, I hate it, I was told to stop all physical activity, not lifting anything (I love to lift my dogs!) no more woodworking for a while... I'm sad.",

193,Mysterious back pains (see link),"Hello r/backpain!

I have a mystery for you.

https://i.redd.it/kp5f4m3jbhz01.png

I've been having some pretty horrendous back pains for avout 6 years now. It's always been a very diffuse pain and I've had no clue what to do.

A while back I posted about it on a few boards on reddit, and one particularly kind redditor suggested I use a tennis ball to massage the tender spots.

And so I did, lo and behold the pains started disappearing from the spot I massaged! I've encircled the area in question in blue (see link). To be clear, I used to have pains in this area, and after massag myself very vigourously, I now have no pains in this area anymore.

However, once the pains in ths area started disappearing, it became easier for me to localize another painful area, encircled in red. This area hurts like a b***h constantly.

I've been faithfully applying my tennis ball to the area, making my back bruised in that spot (as I did for the previous area). This pain however seems far far worse than the first area. I can't figure out what I should do, should I keep massaging this point and hope the pains disappear from this point as it did for the previous point?

A few bits of information:

When I apply a fair bit of pressure at that point I get an almost burning sensation. Otherwise it just feels aching throughout the entire day, especially if I've been sitting upright for a while.

When I hunch over to pick something up I get a very dull, but very painful sensation in that area.

When I've been massaging it particularly aggressively, the spot sometimes gets a tiny bit itchy.

It very much seems to follow the rib encircled on the image. In fact it seems like it's exactly on that rib it hurts.

When I can manage to get my hand back there, it seems like theres a very tiny painful lump I can move around.

The previous pain also followed the ribs, and as mentioned earlier is almost completely gone now.

What even causes such pains? Am I doing the right thing in massaging the area? 

Any and all advice/help appreciated!",

195,Pain near the anus area and Difficulty of bending over,"Hello,

I have been experiencing a very concerning discomfort in my lower back, in the area right next to the anus. From what I can tell it isn't the anus itself but the sacral curve, at least that's what I found from my search in Google. I can feel a swelling, and I have difficulty trying to sit, sleep or in general move my body without feeling pain in that area.
As of late, i've been sitting in my bed for long periods of time while using my laptop, and whenever I felt tired of one position, I moved to another one, then got back to sitting again, and little by little I felt that discomfort growing and growing until I could (and can) no longer sit without feeling pain when bending my spine or bowing to get something from the ground.
Is this related to the spine or to the anus ?

It’s now day 5 of this pain. I can hardly walk, bend down or even sleep comfortable. When I laugh it hurts, when I cough it hurts and when I sneeze it hurts.

209,Can this be fixed? SI joint/nerve pain after PT pissed off muscles.,"So I was perfectly fine, pain free and happy,other than my IC and mild PFD flaring up, so I saw my pelvic floor PT and while she was doing internal work she did something super aggressive that pissed off obturator internus which started nerve pain and spasms and SI joint issues on the left side.  The nerve pain runs from the joint, down the sacrum, out across my butt, wraps around my sit bone and across the left side of my crotch, down the inside and back of my thigh, skips the rest of my leg but hits the last two toes in my foot.  So they started working on the posterior muscle chain ... aggressive cupping on glutes and hamstrings and low back and having me do stretches and exercises with the cups on, and while the SI pain got a bit better, the nerve crotch and sit bone pain stuck around a bit.  And then they went for obturator again and all the symptoms and pain came back 5 fold.    Before it just hurt to sit, now I can't sit, kneel or stand and laying down isn't much relief either.  

So I've fired them as my PT and am trying a new one Monday.  I've made an appointment with my PCP, and I've been wearing an SI belt and taking large doses of CBD.  I've been trying to do exercises for my SI, bridges, etc, but so far no relief.  I'm on a wait list for a PT that specializes in nerves, but that doesn't open up until fall.  I just want my life back!

Is it possible to fix this or am I screwed?",
210,Help me with my Reoccurring back pain,"I am a 32 year old male. 5'9"". 175lbs. Fit and active.

I have been suffering from reoccurring low back pain for about a year. Every 4-6 weeks, I get a sharp pain in my low back, followed by debilitating spasms which last for 2-3 days. Once the spasms go away, and i ""heal"", my back feels GREAT! It honestly feels amazing and like it's brands new. But sadly it's all part of the cycle. I can usually go another 4-6 weeks and then the symptoms start.

After 4-6 weeks, I will start experiencing weakening in the low back with minor aches and pain in my legs. Once this starts, its just a matter of time. This usually last for a week or two, until finally I get the sharp pain again and the spasms start. This has been my life for the last year. Living in constant fear and depression knowing I am on a countdown until the pain comes back. Here are some other details:

• Surprisingly I teach ergonomics at work, and i have never injured my back while lifting or lowering an item. It is always from something like getting up from coach, or out of vehicle, or brushing my teeth (I know it sounds stupid but it's true).

• I do 30min of yoga a day

• I work out (besides yoga) 3 times a week.

• I have a standing desk

• when I sit I use a bouncing ball

• I have an inversion table I try and use once or twice a week

• I sleep with a pillow under knees or in between if I am on my side

• I have the ""better back"" device (kickstarter item) for posture I use every day

• I try and wear shoes in the house now to give me more support

• I use a heat pack about twice a day (ice after first 48 hrs of injury). Not for pain, just as a preventative.

• I drive a lot for work. 6 hour trips in one day multiple times a week. Driving does seem to be what may contribute most to the onset of symptoms. I have a built in lumbar support and I use the seat heater all the time.

• I went to my primary doctor. They said it sounded like a buldging disc, but xrays are fine and so is MRI. They offered PT, which I haven't set up yet, but plan to in the next day.

Since my primary doc said MRI is fine etc, it makes me feel like I might need to see a specialist or something? I read a lot of people say Chiropractors l are great, but further reading makes it sound like there is no evidence for any of that? Though at this point I just want to live a life without the fear of pain.

Based off all the info above, I would really like any advice, uplifting stories, or life changing habits which might help me break this horrible cycle.

-In the lumbar spine, there is a mild disc bulge at L3-L4 and L4-L5.

I was told that I had a pinched nerve/sciatica, and give a steroid injection and an anti-inflammation injection, then sent home with a prescription for muscle relaxers and nsaid pain medication.

It's been a week and while I'm now able to walk, I'm doing so with a lot of pain. Should I return to the doctor before my scheduled appointment (in 2 1/2 weeks)? Will the pain gt better on it's own?",

225,Need Help with Chronic Back Pain,"Hey everyone,
I need some help I am a 24 year old guy who's lower back always hurts. This all started in college after a hard workout nothing traumatic and has gone on since. I work on my feet in a retail environment with good supportive running shoes I replace about every 2 months. I work out 5-6 times a week focusing on cardio and some weight lifting making sure my form is correct. But every morning I wake up with a stiff back that has a burning pain. I can try and crack my back, take a hot shower and nothing seems to help it. Any advice?",
226,Trying to Help My Dad!,"Hi all - hoping I can find some advice or suggestions here because my pop is stubborn and believes he is all out of options. 

Before I get into the details of his diagnosis below, some quick back story information. He is 56 years old, and has been a runner for many years (x2 marathon runner). He has never really weight trained and when he has, he hardly uses correct form (although I’ve helped him with this). I used to see a sports physio therapist who really helped me with priformis nerve pain that radiated from the hip to the foot, and suggested my dad see him as well. The therapist said he couldn’t help him. 

Obviously he is very discouraged and continues to live in pain. I’m not sure what the next step is, he’s gone to other therapist and I believe a chiro as well. He was on the drug Lyrica (sp.?) for some time and he mentioned it helped with the pain but dulled his senses and left him very groggy. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!

Here is his diagnosis: 

Normal alignment. Preserved vertebral heights. Normal craniocervical junction. 

Multilevel degenerative changes:

C3-C4: Asymmetric osteophyte disc complex effacing the CSF right anterior to the spinal cord and minimally indenting the spinal cord. No abnormal signal of the spinal cord. Right foraminal narrowing.

C4-C5: Mild osteophyte disc complex with bilateral mild foraminal narrowing.

C5-C6: Osteophyte disc complex with moderate to severe left foraminal narrowing and minimal right foraminal narrowing.

C7-T1: significant left facet arthrosis, no foraminal narrowing

No significant disc herniations. The degeneration versus hermangioma inferior left endplate C7. Otherwise unremarkable bone marrow. 

Impression: No spinal stenosis, normal signal of the spinal cord. Mild to moderate degenerative changes with multilevel foraminal narrowing as described above  ",
227,Advice on back pain?,"I have had lower back pain for about 10 months. I got the pain doing deadlifts but there was no traumatic event, it just started hurting after a deadlift workout that I thought went pretty well. I have tightness in my low back and sciatica down my right leg stopping a couple of inches above my knee. The tightness is always there but the sciatica is intermittent. I went to a sports medicine doctor about 5 months ago and she basically told me I was fine and it will heal on its own no need for an x-rays or mri. So another 5 months go by and I have the same pain no change. I recently went a chiropractor and he did some x-rays and found I have a slight forward neck tilt, mild scoliosis, and a compressed vertebrae(not sure if it was l4-l5 or l5-s1) which is the thing that he said is causing my low back tightness and sciatica. 

My questions are: 

1. Is just looking at x-rays enough for a chiropractor to make a plan to fix my back problems?(He said it would take 12-18 months of going to him to fix)
2. Should I get a second opinion and or do an mri?
3. Who should I be seeing to diagnose AND fix me. A orthopedic doctor, neurologist, physical therapist, chiropractor?",
228,Progressive injection therapy for low back pain,"Is anyone aware of any progressive injection therapies (stem cell, etc) that is working and will be hitting the main stream in the relatively near future?  After 6-7 years of chronic lower back pain I’m really hoping something of substance is on the horizon!",
229,Thoracic Back Pain - any suggestions?,"I've been having Thorasic Back Pain for about 2 years. It started as an ache on the right side underneath the erector spinae whenever I would be working in a biological hood (right handed, I think I was leaning), following numbeness about 3/4s of a year later in the same spot, to now having a burning sensation on the left side as well. It's chronic, there is no specific event that caused it.

I've visited 3 physical therapists; the first thought it was my right rhomboids are too strong compared to the left, causing my right shoulder blade to be pulled while my left wasn't. The second had me lay down and essentially wiggled my legs, saw that my right wasn't reaching as far as my left and subsequently declared that I had one short leg and scoliosis. An X-Ray showed I did not have scoliosis. The third Physical therapist, upon my request, measured me and said I didn't have a shorter leg. She, similar to the first physical therapist, said my upper left trap was stronger than my right, so she had me focused on strengthening my left trap.

Recently, after about 8 months of seeing her, said that my shoulder blades are aligned, yet since my ailments haven't been resolved, that she, ""didn't know what else to do with me"", and recommend that I get other stuff checked out, such as rheumatoid arthritis, magnesium content, and other stuff. I have appointments set about month out.

Also, just as a note, I've seen a chiropractor (didn't do anything), and I did dry needling 3 times total. The first time completely alleviated my symptoms for 1 week, while the next 2 times didn't do anything. 

This really upset me and demoralized me. I mentioned to her that, although I wasn't able to replicate what I was feeling when we had started, that I was able to now and knew exactly what movement would cause the symptoms. She held her ground though, and refused to set up any more appointments. I feel like she didn't listen to me (or perhaps I'm the one not listening), and I'll be seeing a new physical therapist in about a month hopefully. I can't just set up a new appointment however, because it's the VA and I need to see a doctor first (it's free for me), and I'm a broke-dick college student in the middle of finals and I cannot schedule an appointment for another month. It hurts so bad sometimes that I can't even lay down and read material that I need to focus on.

What specifically causes the pain is a twisting motion when I lean forward. my right rib cage and shoulder will shoot forward while I lean. To replicate, just look at a wall and without moving your arms, imagine punching it with your right nipple (best way I can describe it). This motion happens when I tie my shoes, when I do my dishes, when I stretch, when I pick up weights, and pretty much anything that happens when I reach. I cannot seem to stop this from happening, and the pain happens immediately when this happens. When I sit down, I feel like my back is curved in a backwards ""C"", with my hips and head pointed to the left. I also seem to do this motion with pullups, where my head will lean to the left, but it will still be center between my arms, meaning my spine is bent to the right in a ""C"" fashion.

What exercises can I do at home to help remedy this? I do lots of planks, supermans, dead lifts (when I can hit the gym), and ab exercises, consisting of mainly leg lifts, windshield wipers and some situps. I'm still strong and can do most anything, but I've been putting focus into very light weights and form.

What exercises can I do to ensure I have good form (with regards to twisting) with daily routines and sitting with a straight back? I'm only 27 and this is already ruining my life. Any advice is welcome, thank you",
230,"Physical Therapist told said, ""give me six-twelve months, follow my advice to the letter and I can cure most people's back pain.""","Everything I read says that proper exercise  and time will cure your back pain.  I asked a physical therapist about this and he agreed.  He told me that most people don't have the discipline and patience to cure their back pain.  And they don't do the right exercises, the right away and don't keep to a schedule.

What do you think about this.  Would the majority of people's back pain be gone in 6\-12 months if they just did the right exercises, the right away on a established schedule?",
231,Any idea what's going on here,"I've had this intermittent pain on and off for the last 4 years or so in my lower back. I can go months without any pain, then all of a sudden can come on, and can last up to a week or so. It seemed to have started around the time I got a new computer chair.

It's in my lower back, and occurs to both sides at  the base of the spine. Some days it can be on the left, other times switches to the right.

I've tried to make an appointment with the doctor over the phone 3 times, unless it's serious you don't get to see one. First time he said just stretch, did nothing, 2nd time said to make appointment with physio which I haven't done yet because by the time I do it goes away, then the 3rd he told me to get an xray but didn't hear anything back from that.

When it's really bad it's hard to move, hurts to put any pressure on the leg on the side it's on, tend to walk like John Wayne, and turning over in bed is arduous to make sure I don't catch it. I've tried different stretches, and doesn't seem to make any difference, sometimes makes it worse. It can be bad one day, then the next can dissapear

I know I should probably go see a pysio, but any ideas for now?",
232,Constant Muscle Pain in Mid Back / Stretching not working?,"3 years ago I bought an expensive couch from West Elm. It’s absolutely wrecked my back, and after a year I sold it for something better. It’s been over a year since I got rid of that hellish couch, but my back pain remains the same. I had never experienced back pain before owning that couch. 

I experience radiating heat and tightness in my middle/lower back. I’m confident this is a muscular problem, not a disk problem. I have no sharp pain, no leg or butt pain. This is a hot, glowing pain that lasts all day. It’s radiates from the center of my back, towards my lower back.


What you should know:

28 / male / healthy 
I have excellent posture.
I work at a desk 3 hours per day, stretching every hour.
I have stretched 20+ minutes daily for 18mo
I lift weights 4 days per week
I eat keto / very low carbs 

I am not interested in products or remedies that offer “relief”. (Kratom, opiates, etc.) 

I’m interested in finding out WHY my back still hurts, despite a tremendous amount of effort to correct the problem. I was convinced that a stretching routine would help, but stretching provides relief that last just a few minutes. 5 minutes after a long stretch routine, it’s like I never stretched at all. 

Any ideas? I’m stumped and extremely frustrated.

233,Anyone else have problems starting at an early age?,"I have a L4/L5 disc bulge, L5/S1 disc herniation and dessication, with the latter disc contributing to mild stenosis and retrolisthesis. I'm lucky to live somewhere with world-class doctors, and plan to aggressively address this. I had an epidural injection this afternoon and am starting physical therapy tomorrow afternoon with the clinical director at a top PT office.

Did anyone else have these types of issues in their mid 20's? My pain management doctor told me I'm her youngest patient, which really scares me. I'm wondering if there is any way to predict the course of these issues, and whether or not neurotically seeing doctors will prevent from having more debilitating issues in the future. I know that I'll have to be careful, but can I actually stop the progression of back problems? Is it almost inevitable that I'll have surgery?

236,"Back pain from improper heavy lifting, difficult to interpret","Hey guys, so just under 2 weeks ago, I had to lift some heavy boxes for work, and I'm sure I did so incorrectly and hurt my lower back. The pain has been hard to describe. It's nothing sharp or shooting/throbbing, but a constant stiffness in my lower back. Something I can't quite pinpoint. Furthermore, the area around the inner part of the right iliac crest (mid-right of lower back) exhibits a dull pain. The day after this, I didn't really feel the injury and decided to lift weights, and it became obvious at the bottom of a deadlift when I was bracing my back to bring the weight up. I've stopped the compound lifts since. Even now, 2 weeks later, it's nothing faint, but as soon as I crouch down and act as if I'm bracing to lift a box, the pain becomes apparent.

Does this seem more along the lines of a muscle sprain? Or something more? any input is appreciated. I'm getting it checked out in a couple days, but I'm just getting a bit anxious.",

I have  degenerative disc. It has been very difficult for me to find a chair that I can sit in comfortably in the living room.

I see that the whole chair leans a little down to the left, about 1/4 inch.

So many of the symptoms seem to overlap and I'm having a hard time trying to figure out what's causing my back pain. I've seeing a chiro in about 3 weeks due to my schedule but wanted to try and narrow it down in the meantime so I could start doing some stretches or foam rolling to alleviate the issue.

In my case it's lower back/upper buttocks pain \(no leg or calf pain\) when leaning far forward or backward, but there's no pain at all when standing up for long periods of time, or lying down.",
240,Rip like sensation on left side.,"Just wanted to see if people had any thoughts on this.

Woke up this morning, bent down to look for some shorts and after a few seconds I felt a rip like sensation from the middle of my spine to the left side of my hip. Think of peeling an orange and seeing that rip in the skin.

Anyways. Since I was 18 I've had my back go out on my about 4 times.  The last two times in 2014/2015 I got two MRI's an it was found that I had Dehydrated Disc Disease or Desicated Disc Disease (DDD). I've been ok after it took me a year too recover completely.

That last time, I couldn't even get up from the floor. This time I'm walking but there is a sharp pain on the right side of my lower back and the muscles are tight. I'm currently switching between icing/heating and trying too walk around the house to make sure I'm active. 

My questions:

- Thoughts on what might be happening during this ""flare up""?
- Are there really any viable options for something like this?
- Any links to articles that could help explain the issue?
- Advice on if I should contact a physician at all (feeling kind of hopeless since almost every doctor wants to be conservative with treatment)?",

242,"Right side of back aching, uneven shoulders/back","Hi, back people. I have some trouble with my back on my right side, around the rhomboid area I think. It's tight and aches pretty much daily. The pain isn't that bad, it's about the same intensity as pinching, but it's always there more or less. I suspect that it hurts because my shoulders are uneven or my back is skewed, and I'm hoping that if I can even it out then the pain will stop. I also want to prevent it from getting worse.

Some information:

\- Check the photos to see what it looks like: [https://imgur.com/a/HrjDaMy](https://imgur.com/a/HrjDaMy)

\- My right shoulder seems to be hanging lower than the left one. It also feels like there's less meat on that shoulder. I think it may have been like this for a while because it looks like that in older photos of me. I also notice this when I carry a backpack because I have to tighten the right shoulder strap more than the left to keep the backpack straight on my back and to keep the right strap from sliding off my shoulder.

\- I first noticed the aching when I got into the compulsory military service when I was 18 \(I'm 31 now\), and I carried a heavy backpack. Then I don't remember noticing this anymore until I started weight lifting october 2014 and my personal trainer pointed out that my shoulders were uneven.

\- My doctor says I've got a mild scoliosis and he referred me to a manual therapist.

\- My manual therapist says it's likely a muscle problem and advised me to focus my strength training on my right side, which I've followed for a couple months. This has so far not seemed to correct the aching or my uneven shoulders/back.

\- I have an IT desk job and sometimes it aches when I've been sitting for an hour or two. I have started using a knee chair which has alleviated the pain a bit.

\- The aching is often worse a couple days after I've done heavy deadlifting, or if I've carried something heavy like a backpack without a hip belt or a couch when I was moving into my new apartment the other day.

\- It's sore when I try to stretch the painful area by tilting my head forward and to the left or by doing the typical rhomboid stretch by pressing my right arm into my chest.

\- Also: I am weaker in my right side chest/arm when doing bench press with dumbbells.

Do you have any ideas why it hurts or why my shoulders/back is uneven?

What can I do to correct this?",
243,Bed frame causing back pain?,"The past year or so I've been waking up after 5 to 6 hours of sleep with lower back pain. I've tried switching mattresses from my other bedroom, switching pillows, putting a pillow between my legs... some things have helped but it always seems to get back to pain in my back. This last weekend I went camping and slept on an air mattress and it was the first time I've gotten up in the morning pain free in over a year. It's got me thinking that maybe it's my bed frame? It's an Ikea bed that I've had for I don't know how many years, and I'm worried that all the times I've moved and have taken it apart, put it back together, have kind of loosened where the screws go in and made it not so supportive, plus the slats that go across have one piece that is broken. I tried to fix that piece as much as I can and put it on the other side of the bed from where I lay but don't know if this is what's causing it or not. 

I'm thinking of taking the support beams off, and drilling new holes to screw everything into so that is tight, and maybe going to home depot and buying new 2×4s to use instead. Would this be worth the effort or do I need a new bed?",

So I've been plagued with what I have thought is low left back pain for about 2 years. At this moment it feels like it is more towards my left side deep under my ribs and stretches towards my stomach and towards my low left back. Hip is very sensitive.

I have done physical therapy, seen orthopedics and neurosurgeons. MRI and xrays. Spjnal injections. Every doctor i have spent time with tries a few things then get stumped and passes me to the next person . It starts as soon as I'm on my feet for about 2 hours. It is extremely exaggerated when I tilt my chin towards my chest.

It feels as if it is deep inside of my left side. When I am in pain I tend to poke very hard and deep into my back, my side, and through my stomach in order to try to get some relief. It feels like there's something ripping apart inside of me at all times western I'm sitting, standing and walking The only relief I have is when I lay flat on my back. It is getting harder to pinpoint where the pain is coming from

It is not a kidney issue I have had them checked by a urologist.

Since then I’ve had pain in the *front* of my thighs and my shins/ankles, which is different than last time. The muscles are constantly tight and painful even with religious stretching and foam rolling/trigger point self massage.  The foam rolling and stretching are also pretty painful. 

I’ve also noticed that I have trouble completely emptying my bladder. I have no problem going initially, but I’ll often stand up and realize I still have to go. I can sit on the commode for ten minutes just trying to completely empty my bladder. At first I chalked this up to a UTI (I’m a teacher and spend a lot of time holding it), but I don’t have any other UTI symptoms and it’s been going on for months. I know that not being able to go at all, or loss of control is an emergency and is spine related but this is neither of those things.

* very physically active prior to current pain episode, which has been severe and unabated for nearly eight months now
* was referred to a spine specialist by my PCP after the pain shifted from severe to full-on ""edge of madness"" level
 

**Symptoms:** 
 
* sharp, burning, constant lower back pain that radiates through hips, buttocks &amp; thighs
* muscle spasms throughout affected areas, most severe on left side
* intermittent numbness, tingling &amp; muscle weakness in left leg -- have had to start using a cane to walk

**Diagnosis:** 
 
(via physical exam, x-rays, lumbar MRI &amp; MRI arthrogram in left hip) 

* degenerative lumbar scoliosis &amp; bilateral hip dysplasia
* herniated discs at L4, L5 &amp; S1
* bilateral foraminal stenosis at L5 S1
* intraspinal cyst (type undetermined) at L5 S1
* arthritis in lumbar facet joints

**Treatments (so far):** 

* steroid epidural at L5 S1 nerve root
* bilateral facet injections at L4 L5 &amp; L5 S1
* haven't been approved for PT yet - doctor wants to get my pain down to a functional level first

So, all of that being said, if injections/PT aren't effective, one of the potential treatment options my doctor wants me to consider is fusion and facet replacements at my most degenerated spinal level (L5 S1). From my (admittedly cursory) research, it seems total facet replacement is still a relatively new procedure, so I'd love to hear thoughts about it from someone who's been through it firsthand.

Please share any information you have, especially re: post-op recovery and pain level before/after. Like everyone else in this sub, I'm in abject misery and ready to try basically anything at this point, so I would really, really appreciate any advice you can throw my way.

Thank you SO much!

The pain is in my upper/mid back, between and below my shoulder blades. It's not my spine, but rather the muscles on each side that seem to hurt. Though it may also be my spine, I can't quite tell.

I can't afford those chairs that cost the price of a used car. So I have to make do with the more expensive IKEA chairs which aren't great to be fair. But other people don't seem to be in agony after 5 minutes of sitting. What could be wrong with me?

I'm not asking for a medical diagnosis, just tips on whether this is normal after just a few years of computer work, and whether back exercises should help or something. To those experiencing the same issue, what helped?",
257,Lower back pain,"So about a year ago I had a sporting injury which hurt my lower back, so I went to a physio after it didn't get better and this relieved a lot of the issues (tight muscles etc.). Fast forward a few months and there's still a dull pain at the base of the spine at times when I'm stood up or still for a long time. Went to a osteopath who checked it out and said spine seems to be fine it's just the way I've been using it, too much pressure on lower back etc., and that I should get back into sport. This morning I went out for a run and since coming back I've had a light tingling/pins and needles (not bad by any means but it is definitely there) in my left foot. 

I've booked another appointment with the osteopath in four days time but is this something I should be worried about, try and get seen sooner?",

260,Back pain tips and suggestions?,"I'm hoping to get some insight into my back pain. I'm a programmer so I sit at a desk constantly all day. Over the past 10 years my back problems have been getting worse to the point where even just standing around in the kitchen cooking is painful.

I remember a specific time when I was maybe 21 years old (I'm 31 now) that I pulled out my back and was in bed for a few days. The last time I pulled my back out was 2 years ago right before my wedding. I also remember being around 16 or 17 years old and having to cut the grass for my mom as a chore, but not being able to physically do it without resting often because of back pain.

The pain is in my lower back on the left side and radiates upward to just beneath my left shoulder blade. I feel hardly any pain at all on the right side. Even though the pain is constant, it actually takes some physical effort to get REALLY painful. For example I can cook in the kitchen for 5 minutes with only minor pain, but the longer I go on the more and more it hurts until I basically feel like I'm going to collapse.

I've tried changing my shoes, my posture, losing weight, stretching, drinking less, eating healthier... but I'm willing to try anything at this point.

Does anyone have any tips or suggestions? I'm living abroad at the moment and won't be able to see an English speaking doctor until June- but is there any specific type of doctor I should see? Anyone have any ideas on what this may be? Seriously anything would help at this point.",
261,2 herniated discs + no insurance. Need exercise advice!,"Hi! I’m a healthy 28 yo female. I herniated two discs about a month and a half ago. Pain was really bad, but recovery has been significant and noticeable.

I was given heavy doses of oral steroids which really helped, in combination with lots of ibuprofen. I was also supposed to start physical therapy, however the company I worked for shut down, and I no longer have insurance :(. This is super unfortunate because I definitely can’t pay out of pocket so I need to find a new job ASAP.

While I work on the insurance, I wanted to see if anyone here could provide me with some exercises I can start doing to regain strength in my back, legs, and core (that won’t put stress or pain on my discs). I will see a physical therapist once I get insurance, but until then I’d like to start doing something. I can walk and move around mostly. I still can’t sit down yet. Also still can’t drive (requires sitting).

Any tips will be so so helpful.

I did finally argue with my doctor (Cause a month or this is ridiculous) to get an MRI done. I think it's  just the bone one though. I've tried physical therapy last year but it made it worse any time I went beyond the basics. What else should I be looking at for doctors? Obviously a new general practitioner..

273,"Sleeping back pain, goes away within 30 minutes of waking.","Morning guys. Hoping to get some suggestions.

Several months ago, I started experiencing back pain throughout the night. Sometimes thoracic between the shoulder blades, sometimes below the shoulder blades, and sometimes lumbar. Typically it gets worse as the night goes on. I'm able to get  through it by switching positions (whichever position is contacting the bed seems to be inflamed).

All that said, as soon as I get out of bed the symptoms start to withdraw and most are gone within 30 minutes.

I'm 38 years old, physically fit and active with both exercise and sports (volleyball). I'm always extremely careful when it comes to working within my limits and proper form. I typically have zero pain during exercise or sports. I've never had an acute injury (I do get a very occasional spasm that bothers me for a  day or so).

I have a select comfort bed. I typically always had it set to pretty firm 90-100, but since this has started I've tried as low as 30 and everywhere in between with no change in symptoms.

Any recommendations, thoughts on what might be the cause, or links to information would be greatly appreciated.",
274,Back pain after lifting just about anything,"Hey guys 

I'm a 28 year old male with back problems. I started a new job in january of last year and problems started in august of last year. 

To start, I don't have the ideal job for my back. However until last august I didn't have any issues. I work at the register of a very busy local company. This means I have to turn my back alot (to put money in the register). I can either sit down or stand up (I do both). Like I said, before august I had no problems so I'm not 100% sure this is the cause of my back aches. 

So in august of last year, we had to move a bunch of stuff in the office. Being a young guy, I was one of the volunteers (okay they asked me lol). This took a few days and on the third day I hurt my back. I was in pain for about 10 days (stayed home for those days). 

I noticed afterwards that I had slight pain at work, but not at home. Because the pain persisted I visited my doctor and he prescribed a specific strenght training programme (which I do at the hospital). I have to train lower back, upper back and abdomen muscles (both by weight lifting and body exercies) plus cardio: cycling, waling/running, rowing

But the problems persists. We can all hurt out back when we lift very heavy objects (like I did), but I hurt my back even lifting relatively light things. For example, I tried to mow the lawn three days ago and I'm still in heavy pain.

The pain typically lasts between 4 and 7 days (depending on the weight). Afterwards the pain is completely gone at home (and sometimes light pain at work). So I've been largely pain free for the last 2 months.
I always have pain in one specific part of my lower back (roughly the middle of my lower back). I'm also always mad at myself when I hurt my back, ""I should have known not lift/move this stupid thing!!""

I've taken an MRI and a bone scan to search for decay and inflammation. Both showed nothing! The doctor first said that my problems are purely muscular but since things aren't improving he suggested an epidural injection in the specific region, but I'm no fan of this. Especially since a neurosurgeon I visited in january (and made me take the MRI) said he would think it shamefull of him to charge me an epidural.

Does anyone have any idea what I have? Appearantly both doctors say they haven't really encountered this (lucky me...) and since I can't lif anything I feel like I can't progress in my life (last year I was planning to hire my own place)

I'm also looking around for another job, but the pay is awesome and so are most of my coworkers and boss. If I was sure this was the cause I'd change jobs in a heartbeat, but I'd hate to change to a lesser job and not improve.

edit: I've also bought a tempur mattress which definitely helps when I'm in pain, I can reccomend it to everyone!
edit2: just bought back mechanic, I hope it'll help

276,Back popped when standing up (no weight),"Hi guys,

Today I popped my lumbar spine when standing up after putting down some weights. No pain but stiffness in the area and I continued to do slow bodyweight movements in order to draw blood to the area and avoid more stiffness. It's now 5 hours later and hardly any stiffness left and I'm able to bend/squat/tie shoe laces as normally with a hint of stiffness but no pain. I've got ice on my back, had a muscle relaxing bath and hot/cold shower after gym.

My question is what is the cause for this? I had a similar injury to my elbow where after doing ab cable crunches I let go of the cable, leant against the wall with my hand and felt a 'spring' popping feeling. Almost as if me leaning against the wall released all the energy from my arm that had been tightly holding the cable.

I'm preparing to wake up tomorrow stiff as a board. :D

277,Recurring Pain in Mid Lower Back,"I've had this pain for a week now, and I could best describe it as a pain in my mid lower back, when arching my back to stretch, and when reaching down to my toes. I sit in an office 8 hours a day, which does not help, but only recently has it started when I'm sitting still at work. The pain usually happens when arching back or forwards.

The pain is a tight feeling, the feeling as if you're about to crack your knuckles but it wont crack but get stuck. The pressure I feel when pressing against my back is real high.

I've also been practicing the child pose with arms extended, and that pose is the only way i could ""stretch"" that part of my back, but when I do, the pain gets worse and even lingers a while.

Should I see a doctor? Or just get my back adjusted at a chiropractor.",

279,Life After Slipped Disc?,"In October I slipped on ice and fell down a flight of stairs, resulting in two herniated discs (L4/L5, L5/S1 I believe).  Symptoms: back pain, mainly in lower back/butt.  Pain down left leg, mostly in the back of the left thigh.  Trouble bending, exercising, general day to day things.  

A brief overview of treatment in the last few months:
Two rounds of oral steroids
Lots of advil/tylenol
Muscle relaxers
Upping Lyrica (originally taken for migraines) 
Cortisone injection (95% relief for 2 days, 60-70% relief for 3-4 weeks).  I can pinpoint when the relief stopped: two possible causes are a bad day at PT or missed dose of lyrica... or both
Chiro (before seeing an ortho)
Voltaren gel, voltaren oral
PT... which has been a nightmare.
One doctor suggested surgery which I'd like to stay away from if necessary.  I'm also under the impression he doesn't have an accurate assessment of my symptoms and relief the injection gave me.
I have an appt coming up with a chiro who has helped two friends with back pain/disc problems.

First thing is the clinic I'm at is a bit of a mess... but I was recommended to go there via my PCP and good friend who worked for back doctors in the area for several years.  They have PT in house and one of the PTs was highly recommended by a few folks.  It's been hard to follow a treatment plan as I'm given different exercises every time I go in, and the doctors don't finish their notes on times for the PTs to read.  I was also given incorrect information at my surgery clinic and it's been hard to get my medications refilled.  

My insurance will be changing at the end of April and I'll be seeing a completely new set of doctors.  

TL/DR: Tried a bunch of stuff, back and left leg still hurts.  Getting frustrated and worried.  Where can I go from here?

My questions: What else can I do for treatment? What alternative treatments have helped other folks?  What forms of exercise are safe?  Any other words of advice?",
280,"Lower back pain for ~10 years now. I'm a bit desperate, but found some light at the end of the tunnel. Can anyone help?","Hi, 
First of all I apologize for this long post, but I'm a bit desperate after 10 years of constant pain. I will try to give as much details as possible, hoping that someone can point me in the right direction. 

I don't remember having any back injury.  I don't even remember when it all started. I used to have some back pain here and there. there were days that I wasn't able to stand up straight, but I ignored the symptoms and they were gone after few days.  

Fast forward few years to ~3 years ago. Pain is constant.  Top of the hip bone area. Difficult to describe what kind of pain, just a dull pain. Whole back super tight. Much worse in the morning. Went to doctor. did X-rays. told me to do some exercises. Sent me for PT. Didn't help.  I figured I'll just live with it. 

1-1.5 year ago pain got worse. Sometimes I would get like sharp stabbing pain when walking. The pain for so intense that I would just freeze mid stride, I couldn't move for 20-30 seconds, and then it would let go. Back to that dull pain.   I figured it could be a muscle spasm, pinched nerve, or maybe a damaged spine bone catching onto something? (not sure if that's even possible but I thought of the worst). Went to doctor. xrays etc. found bulging discs, sent me for PT again. I did 4-5 months of PT 2x a week. Traction table, some core strengthening exercises, dry needling, heat &amp; stim, cupping, graston.. nothing was helping. traction seemed to make it worse.  Finally PT person tried ""psoas release"". It was painful as hell. But immediately after, the pain was pretty much gone.  Unfortunately not for long. few hours later, back to square one.
 
Went back to back doc. he sent me to another doctor specializing in nerve block injection. He said they need to perform 2 successful test injections before they can do actual procedure  (I don't remember exactly the name of procedure - I think they were supposed to burn off the nerve endings by facet joints).  Went for the first test, where they inject anesthetic. Didn't see a difference. Doc says - need another test.  went to another test few weeks later, but that day I had no pain at all, so he said it doesn't make any sense to do it. I figured I'm heading in the wrong direction. Especially that psoas release helped immediately. Never went back for test #2. 
Went to chiropractor. Good guy. Thinks outside of the box. Went for 5-6 visits. adjustments made my back ""looser"" but pain was still there. Massaging psoas helped for 1-2 hours. He said something is causing the muscles to tighten that quick. He couldn't say what though. He told me to try kneeling chair. I did, and it helped a little bit.  He was also suspecting Ankylosing spondylitis, since tightness is much worse in the morning. Sometimes It's difficult to get up from bed, and back is super stiff for some time. He also said it could be stress related, so he sent me to naturopath for some cortisone testing. That was a dead end. 

So I went to my PCP. Blood test, and back MRI.   MRI showed small central based protrusion L4-5 without central canal compromise, retrolisthesis L5-S1 with broad based central disc protrusion and right foraminal narrowing, no evidence to suggest ankylosing spondylitis.   Blood test came back HLA-B27 positive. So rheumatologist visit was in order.  Rheumatologist saw HLA-B27 positive and automatically blamed the pain on non radiographic spondyloarthrisis and recommended Humira (on the first visit lol). When I asked for reasoning, the answer was ""I'm a doctor and I have experience"".  I left and never went back.  Thinking about going to another rheumatlogist, but I'm not sure if I should. 

PCP said that the pain is coming from the spine degeneration, and that there's nothing that can be done. ""be careful what you do, and here are some pain meds"".   They're all quick to prescribe oxy and other stuff.     I tried pain meds, but they did not seem to help. Maybe the pain was gone, but the back tightness was not. 

So few days ago I went to a highly recommended acupuncturist. I told him the story, he smiled, didn't say much, just stabbed me with a lot of needles lol. He's an old chinese guy, barely speaking english, so the communication is very limited.  He said that it will take some treatments but I should see the difference.  He told me to be very careful with the spine (the l4/5, s1/l5 damage). I saw some improvement after 1st treatment. Back less tight. Pain still there. Few hours after 2nd  treatment the pain was gone. for like an hour or so, but it was gone. At least I think it was. It was much much less than normally anyway, and I was able to bend without any stiffness. The bliss lasted an hour or so. 3rd treatment - he added some cold laser therapy. Right after, I almost wasn't able to get up from the table. lots of pain and stiffness, but few hours later the pain was gone again. I almost felt like a newborn baby. Being able to move pain-free is a beautiful feeling. It lasted much longer, few hours. Then yesterday I had no treatment (Sunday), the pain / stiffness was minimal. Today - I woke up, and the pain and stiffness is back. I have acupuncture visit in few hours.  While it gives me some relief, I have a feeling this is also a dead end. Cause it's all very temporary. 

I also tried following recommendations from McGill Back Mechanic Book. The self assessment was a failure. Nothing really worked. 

Here are photos of Xrays and MRI: https://imgur.com/a/T6nJY

So here I am. Seems like I hit a wall. Low back pain for years, got worse in last ~2 years.  No one seems to know what's wrong with my back. No one can tell what hurts and what's causing the pain. I'm in pain physically, but also mentally. I have a toddler, that a lot of times I'm not able to pick up from bed / floor or play with him.  

Any suggestions? Any other types of doctors I should go to? Any tests? Anything? 
Acupuncture gave me some relief, so I'm thinking it's muscle-related pain. And just because I'm getting few hours of less / no pain, I believe I can live pain free one day. I just have no idea how to make that happen

281,Instability all the way,"Hey there, I wonder why I haven't found this subreddit before.

I'm curious about your opinions whats going on with my back. I'm 40yo about normal weighing man. No ""hard"" sports background, just some gym and jogging. First of all, I've had several lower back issues for years, L4-L5 protrusions with sciatica pains etc. I have no issue with other joints in my body but spine is giving me daily hell. I've had MRI few years ago of my pelvic region when those protrusions where officially confirmed and also slight lowering of the joints (sorry English is not my native language). But now it seems I have more larger issue behind it all. 

My joints go misaligned all the time. Popping, cracking and muscle spams due misalignments. One day it could be familiar L4, L5 region, then it can be thoracic region or even up to C regions. I thought that my lower back was due weak abs/core/back but now it seems that the issues is more around the joint all over the spine instead of specific support muscle groups. Every morning I wake up and lower back or pelvic area is tilted or twisted. Then I need to ""throw each of my legs over"" to open them. Sometimes it doesn't work if the spams are too hard. Sometimes my thoracic joints go twisted and I need to do all sorts of yoga or flexing movements.

I've seen osteopaths, chiropractics, doctors and physiotherapists. Everyone seem the current issue as the correct one and no-one really sees my back and muscles as a whole. 

Now to my point, I wonder if someone else is suffering from the same or does someone know if there is some known medical condition which could fit?

284,Lower back pain from heavy lifting 3 years ago still isn't healed.,"Hi,

I started lifting when I was 15 years old and I tried to beat my personal deadlift record when I wasn't ready for it yet (I could lift it but my muscles couldn't, at the expense of my spine). Since then I've noticed my lower back is prone to pain. It feels kind of inflamed. I have better weeks sometimes, but most of the time I really need to lie down after even sitting in a chair for a while. It doesn't hurt when standing, walking/running or lying down. Only when sitting, lifting objects, and bending forward. I'm trying to have ""good"" sitting posture but then it hurts even more (maybe this could be an indicator as to what's the culprit?). I'm not even sure whether it's a disc, a muscle or a tendon. So here I am. Does anyone recognize these symptoms? Maybe I never let my back heal long enough to be healed completely? And how do I even do this, given that I have a sedentary lifestyle and sitting makes it worse?

285,Need advice for back pain before ski trip,"I've been dealing with back pain for a while now. Generally it's not too bad (hurts when standing for a while but back to normal quickly after sitting), but occasionally something happens (an injury I guess) and I become unable to do basic things like bending down without sharp pain. In the past when this has happened it has healed within a week or so.

This time it seems to be taking longer to heal than usual, and doesn't seem to be getting any better with time. It's in my lower back, more to the left side, and it hurts a lot when I push down on the areas around and below my lower back.

I'm going on a ski trip this weekend (expensive lift tickets already bought and everything) and I really want to be able to ski without hurting myself because of my back.

I think I have anterior pelvic tilt and I know I need to do stretches to prevent this from happening in the future. But at the moment I am looking for any advice on how to get this current injury to heal as fast as possible and at least alleviate some of the pain. Are there particular stretches I should do working up to skiing? Should I foam roll (and if so, which areas)? Use certain heat pads or medication? Should I stand or sit more? Sleep on my back or side? Etc.

I'm a mother of 2 young girls so I'm always running around running errands and such. About 2 years ago, following a shoulder surgery, I lifted something awkward and got the snap crackle pop thing in my back. I had been over-compensating for at least a year at the time for my bad shoulder by using my good shoulder for everything. My back was killing me after that, I got checked out, they gave me one of those shots for the pain, I did the typical care, ice and such. Eventually I stopped paying attention to it, as my shoulder was really the focus.

I got to start playing my sax again and my back started bothering me a lot all over again. Sitting for long would hurt, standing for a 45min set would be painful. Eventually, my foot was numb and it didn't go away for 5 days so I went to the ER. I did my follow up visit afterwards and was told that I had arthritis in my back per the x-ray I had done. Basically they told me I needed to manage the pain since it isn't reversible. I dealt with it.

Fast forward 10 months, I was rear ended in December, then hit by a car as a pedestrian in January and while going to PT for my back due to the accident I recently had an MRI done. It said I have 2 bulging disks, my disks are degenerative, my nerves are being compressed, etc. 

For the medical terms type people:
At L5-S1, there is diffuse annular bulge present measuring up to 3mm. There is moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis. Canal is mildly stenotic. Bilateral hypertrophic facet disease and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy contribute. 
At L4-L5, 3mm bulge is seen. Both foramina are narrowed. Canal is patent. Bilateral hypertrophic facet disease is seen. 

The disk on my Mri looks like a chunk of it is missing. I've been getting some chiropractic adjustments lately at PT but I can't help but think it's going to continue to get worse. I look at the progression in the past 2 years and can only think of how bad it could be in 10 years when I'm 40. I've even bought a new mattress due to the pain. I medicate myself to perform my gigs. My back hurts during grocery shopping. 

I'm trying to figure out some lifestyle changes that may steer me in the right direction. The doctors don't seem interested in trying to fix the problem, more so just managing the pain. I used to be a very active person, Iraq veteran, I used to trick skate, swim team, all that junk. It's like my life is being put on hold because of my back, but even though I'm not doing anything extreme, it's still getting worse. 

I'm thinking about seeing a different doctor, as the VA Dr's are the ones that just wanted to give me pain meds, the doctor for the car accident is only interested in fixing the bulging disks since the other injuries could only come over time and therefore aren't tied to the accident. I don't know if it's worth it though. I always wind up with medical bills when I go outside the VA. 

I'm thinking of diet changes, I want to do aqua therapy but I can't get myself together to go to the gym. I just want to live a healthier life to slow down this process. I'm sorry this turned into a rant. But I really do worry about the future. I had a rental car recently and it hurt every time I got in and out of it because it was too low to the ground. ",
287,Leg numbness,"Hello, 

I posted here yesterday. I'm on painkillers but still don't know what/where specifically my back injury is. My left leg numbness gets pretty bad when I'm sitting, which I of course do at work all day. 

Any recommendations for more comfortable sitting positions? 

I'm not in a  lot of pain, but the numbness and feeling of nerves firing etc is like nails on a chalkboard all day long. My back making popping noises s I move a lot of the time.'

288,Strengthening abs vs strengthening lower back muscles,"I have a back injury that causes my lower back muscles to tighten up when I stand for too long. I have always been told that the best way to deal with this is to strengthen my abs and do stretches. My question is, why is it more important  I strengthen the abs than to strengthen the lower back muscles themselves? Both ab exercies and lower back exercises seem to help with the stiffness so why is it that ab exercises are usually the sole recommended treatment for back tightness?",
289,Dull lower back pain and tightness,"Hey guys, my lower back has been hurting on and off for a few years. Pain I believe is right at the base of the spine and is very dull. No shooting or radiating. I can feel it when I flex my abs and do ab work, as well if I've been laying on the couch for a while then stand up and for some reason when I do seated rows at the gym. I also can't bend forward at the hip, almost at all, unless I get in a hot shower and really force it. Doc took an x-ray and said he can see a slight curvature of the spine but no signs of disc problems. Do you guys think it's just super tight hamstrings? Anyone have anything similar?",

291,6 months ago I was told I have a degenerating disc in l5 s1 Also my left buttock usually has an ache near the spine,For the last 6 months or so I've had a kind of burning in my lower lumbar region I think is due to repeated strain I've had to back muscle strains and sprains in the last six to seven months it feels like my piriformis muscle in my left side is currently acting up it always feels like my tailbone is sore also sitting in bending causes discomfort as well as a slight burning pulling sensation in the lower lumbar area what's going on,
292,Problems With Right Trapezius. Suggestions?,"I'm a 23 year old female student, and I had a back spasm during January, while sitting hunched over at my computer - so, bad posture most certainly caused it I'm sure. Initially, I went to the doctor who gave me some muscle relaxers and a paper with stretches, and it mostly got better, but it came back when I attempted to do a shoulder workout two weeks ago, so I guess I hurt it again.

I've noticed that points of issues are along my right trapezius. The main pain point is right between my lower shoulder blade and spine, and then I have a knot at the top of my neck, and an insanely hard knot at the base of my neck. The knots do not hurt, but I haven't been able to get the one at the base of my neck to release at all. I have weird, almost peripheral-like numbers in the whole area of a my trap, and it gets worse and more painful when I lay on my back at night. Hot showers sometimes make the numbness slightly worse, though I did it to see if the heat could help release the knots.  For a while I would randomly get this numbness/weakness that would run almost in a line from near the pain point between my shoulder blade and spine, diagonally down and around my right side. I haven't had it happen in a while, but it was concerning. 

Doing machine flys before I hurt it again seemed to help, but I've been afraid to re-attempt it, or really do much upper body for that matter (I'm not an experienced lifter, I only started over the summer). Anyone have any suggestions for fixing things, or any advice on the weird numbness? ",

After one my of doctors said I need surgery I decided to try Ayurveda. I took meds for a few months then spent a month at an ayurvedic hospital and right now in pretty much fine. On some evenings I have a a slight discomfort in either one of my legs but other than that I'm fine. I can walk,sit for a long time and run without any problems.  I couldn't even sit or walk before.

296,Upper back issues - need suggestions,"I'm 30 years old male and a couple of months ago I started to feel a pain in my right shoulder blade. I started to working out (found videos on youtube how to stretch and strengthen your rhomboids, etc) and the pain is (mostly) gone but I still feel occasional numbness, tickling and itching. 

Usually, this numbness and tickling is occurring when I'm doing something with my hands. Like folding clothes or dishwashing on example, or some other physical stuff. It goes away after a few minutes, then it comes back, depending on the circumstances. 

I have kyphosis and scoliosis and as you can see on the 4 pictures I've uploaded, my right shoulder blade is more pronounced than my left one. https://imgur.com/a/h7jDo

298,Upper Right Back and Neck Pain,"Hi,

I am a white 25 year old male living in Washington state. I am 6'0 tall and 185 pounds and I occasionally smoke marijuana. I am not on any medications and I have had upper right back and neck pain for 2 and half years. My mother has arthritis and osteoporosis and is 58 years old.

In late September 2015 I was helping my dad repair the driveway. As I bent over and began picking up one of the heavy (about 50 pounds) concrete mix bags, I felt an excruciating pain on the upper right side of my back as I was lifting it up. All day my dad had been telling me to correct my posture and I suffered the consequences.I went to see a general practitioner months later and they told me it sounded like a muscle strain.

Almost 3 years later the pain has not gone away. I am a student who spends a lot of time on the computer and studying. I cary a backpack quite often and workout a few times a week. It seems to get worse after studying. It also seems worse towards the end of the day and better in the morning. Some days are worse than others. There are some days where the pain is almost non existent and others where it is so bad I want to scream. My neck also hurts on that side, so does my jaw. I was told I had TMJ when I was a kid. My jaw on that side seems misaligned and moves out of place when I open my mouth wide. I grind my teeth.

The best way I can describe the pain in my back is a sharp stabbing pain when I angle my my neck a certain way. It is more of a dull pain that I can feel there when I am stationary. My neck cracks a lot, all of my joints do. My joints do not hurt when I crack them though. My neck on the right side hurts more when I stretch it. More recently back and chest workouts seems to irritate that spot in my back and neck. I have let off on those exercises for the last couple of months. Cold rainy weather seems to make it worse too. Also when I take a very big deep breath it flares up that spot in my back. Other than the back and neck pain, I feel fine. I love going on long walks and hikes.

I feel all around better when I am standing up. Stretching my back and using a back roller seems to help my back too. Hot showers seems to help.

What could this be? A joint? A pinched nerve or degenerating or bulged disk?

One thing is that I am so scared to go see a doctor and have tests run. I am terrified that there's going to be some horrific news like I have cancer or something and I am so scared. I think I am going to have to soon though. I thought coming here would be a good first step.

Thank you.",

I've gotten CAT scans and X-Rays - they can't find anything, which I suppose is a good sign. However, it's so uncomfortable there's gotta be some way around it.

I am a fun person lol.

Any who. Two weeks ago I had surgery to remove a benign tumor in my brain. It was an acoustic neuroma and my recovery has been really really good. 

So the reason for my post. 
When I had surgery I ended up with a lumbar drain. :/

I swear they hit my nerve funny because now I have the most severe nerve pain running down my legs. The left side is by far the worst I have ever had it. 
I am falling, having to quickly just sit on the floor instead of fall. I am getting waves of electric nerve pain in my pelvis all day and night. 
I am not a stranger to nerve pain like this but it’s got me to tears. I have a referral to Occupational and physical therapy. I will be starting physical therapy next week and occupational is coming by the house tomorrow to see if I need in home or out patient occupational therapy. Physical therapy did their evaluation today and I don’t qualify for in Home even though I can’t drive yet. So once they update the referral for out patient and I get my stitches out Tuesday I can make the appointment. 

I am also thinking I need to ask for a cane. Even temporarily. I am falling to much it’s making me nervous to use the oven and things that could really hurt me. I already fell in the tub so we bought a bar for the tub. 

The tumor was also on the bundle of nerves that control hearing, balance, eye movements, facial nerve. The whole vestibular system so balance and vertigo are also a thing and I am adjusting to being deaf in my right ear too. 

So hi. Lol
I am still my happy normal self. I am looking forward to getting past this new set of obstacles. I start school in the fall again to get my degree for special education. I am a stay at home mom to two kids on the autism spectrum. I don’t have time for this lol. ",

304,Cervical Herniation Advice Please!!!,"Hello,

I am a 23yo male who has severely herniated 2 disks in my neck back in January. I have received 2 epidural injections since then with little to no improvement. Over the last week I have had to go to the hospital 3 times for pain management as my pain killers and muscle relaxers no long have any effect. This is the most pain I have ever experienced in my life by far and it has left me bed ridden. I am sleeping between 1 and 3 hours a night as well. 

I am taking numerous supplements to try and increase the speed of healing including vitamin C, vitamin D, MSM, fish oil, zinc and magnesium. Additionally I preform traction as much as possible and have an inversion table as well.

I am writing here because I am not sure what to do from this point. My doctor is leaning towards a double vertebrae fusion surgery from C5-C7 which I am trying to avoid at all costs. Although, if it will provide me with long term relief than I will go that route.

If anyone has any advice, opinions, doctor recommendations or anything at all that may help me in any way please feel free to send me a message or respond here. Thank you so much!",

Stopped lifting almost entirely though I do a lot of bodyweight, movement, and yoga work now, as well as adding basketball to my weekly workouts. 

I'm worst off at rest, and sleeping is my biggest challenge. When I've inflamed my injury, I can guarantee only a few hours sleep per night unless I take naproxen. Interestingly, that knocks it out not just for the duration of the dose, but until the next time I aggravate it. It's almost as if when I've upset it, no amount of stretching or resting or ice or heat or lidocaine or turmeric or anything else has any effect, leaving me with chronic pain for days and longer.  But even just 1-2 regular Aleve pills knocks it out immediately and until the next indecent.

323,Recurring low/middle back pain,"Hi fellas,   

I'm 25, my height is 1.83m and I'm weighing about 90kg. I started with weightlifting when I was about 15 and lifted for three years consistently. When I got into the college I've decided that I'll fully focus on my studies and therefore I made a huge break from lifting that lasted for 4 years.  

I'm back into the gym for about 2 years now and I have the following issue.  

Two weeks ago I was warming up for the OHPs (with 40kg or so), and in a moment when I was breathing out and pushing the bar above my head I suddenly felt a very deep stabbing-like pain on the right side of my back. I couldn't locate the pain exactly, but it was somewhere between low and middle back, on this huge muscle that goes along the spine (I'd say it was erector spinae muscle). Of course, the day after situation was quite bad, I had a constant pain and when walking I was also nudging to the right side. I've realized that I probably pinched a nerve and therefore I didn't lifted for about 5-6 days, and I was doing [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWmGArQBtFI) and a few more exercises and the pain went away. Such pain has also appeared maybe twice during my ""lifting career"" but in a relatively weaker fashion from some heavy deadlifts.  

This week I got back into lifting and due to my recent injury I really did a lot of stretching and warming up before exercises. However, yesterday while I was squatting, on my last set again I felt a short stabbing-like pain on my lower back. I've ignored it and finished my workout since the pain wasn't that bad. When I cooled off from lifting, the pain got more intense but it was still tolerable. However, this morning I got into nightmare. I've barely made it from the bed to the bathroom and I'm lying the whole day. I feel a constant pressure on the right side of my lower/middle back (I'd say it is somewhere between my ribs) and when I make any movement that involves movement of my torso the pain gets intolerable - I start feeling very painful ""stabbing"" along the right side of lower/middle back (actually along my rib cage). Heavy breathing hurts and sneezing hurt as well. From these symptoms I'd say that I got Intercostal Muscle Strain.  

I booked an appointment with the chiropractor on Wednesday and I hope that he will solve this for me. I guess that there are dozens of you out there that experienced such issues at least once and thus any sort of advice would be helpful here. In addition to resting and using sport gels, what to do for a pain relief, which home exercises or stretches have helped you, and most importantly how to prevent such injuries in future?  

Thanks in advance.

327,Low back pain - disc issues &amp; cortisone injection,"Hello, I’ve been having lower back pain for the past 5 months - I’ve tried the chiropractor, physical therapy, gotten an X-ray (which was fine) and last week got an MRI. I’m a otherwise healthy 30 year old woman. It’s been the most annoying experience of my life and I didn’t “do” anything to injure my back but the pain is constant. 

The primary care physician I saw initially recommended me to what I would call an “injection farm” - she didn’t even tell me what they do but when I called they told me they do shots. I mean all I had at that point was a clean X-ray, so what would a shot do without an MRI? Nothing. So I skipped that and tried PT. Been doing PT for two months with no noticeable improvement, so I just sucked it up, got an MRI, and took it to the shot place. Which of course they recommended a cortisone injection, after seeing I had a bulging (I think it was bulging? She didn’t say herniated) disc. I wish I had asked more questions but they seemed rushed and not like they wanted to fully explain what was wrong with me, or what the injection does or what to expect. All I gathered was it reduces inflammation. 

I’m sorry that this is so long winded. I feel very defeated and like I have no one to truly help me, I guess. Every doctor I’ve seen is convinced they can help but they haven’t. So who do I trust? I feel like I will be in pain forever and I’m young. Does this shot help? Does it help forever? Has anyone gotten it and willing to tell me what to expect? Any help is appreciated...thanks 💕",

So has anyone had this surgery done?  Did it help at all?  How’s the recovery?  I’m nervous since it’s my first surgery, but I want the pain to go away!  

****Update****
I had my surgery today and I feel fan freaking tastic!!!  Oh my gosh, why couldn’t I do this sooner. I’ve been out of the hospital since before noon and I’m already walking better than I was before!  Other than the pain from where I got sliced open and for some reason my calves (guessing from compression socks they made me wear) I feel fabulous. I’m so excited to live my life again. My surgeon said because of how badly my herniation was, there’s a chance for a fusion in the future. But now I’m going to get my life together, start exercising and lose all the weight I put on when I first hurt myself. If anyone doubts doing the surgery, don’t. It’s absolutely the best thing that has ever happened to me. ❤️❤️❤️. My life is back!  ",

334,L4-L5 Epidural Cortisone Injection with Anesthetic for severe Herniated Disk and Disk Desiccation.,"I just got my Sciatic Nerve injected yesterday with Steroids, as is stated in the title. 

It's for an L4-L5 posterior-lateral herniation, apparently a nasty one. 

When the steroid was injected, I felt the whole nerve light up in a very weird yet familiar sensation. That's a good thing because the target nerve was met acutely with the fluid (with fluoroscopic guidance).

The anesthetic eliminated the pain entirely for about 2 hours or so, then the typical pain increased after that. This pain is now stronger than before the injection, which again I have been told is a good sign of the correct area being treated (it's now filled with a foreign fluid and my nervous system is having a response to that. 

The odd thing about the 'new' pain, is that it's not as much of a stabbing, shooting, electrical type of pain as it has been... now it's more of a muscle soreness, like a really bad impact bruise. It's a welcome alternative to the debilitating sensation from the past, but in a way it's actually stronger. 

I want to share my experience for any folks getting this common shot in the future.

Also, can anyone relate to this 'new' type of pain? This is my first shot, so what can /r/backpain give me with respect to tips, what-to-expect, and whether or not I should INCREASE my stretching now that the pain allows it, or should i not get cocky and let the disturbed area chill out for a few days?

335,Sports and Scoliosis,"Hi there everyone! I'm starting a little research project, mostly as motivation to keep taking care of my back but as well to gather information for anyone else who might come across my situation (which I reckon is quite common). 

I've always been into sports...all kinds actually, but really keen on both **basketball** and **surfing**! This was an amazing thing growing up but, as I got older things started to get a bit more difficult, I started having problems breathing deeply, and the neck &amp; back pain became a constant after every session.
Turns out I had a mild scoliosis. Nothing serious, so with the right treatment it got me feeling better after a while...good enough to return to my routine. Now, fast forward a few years and I started working, sitting down for longer periods of time, and not paying attention to my posture at all...until I decided to go for a run and almost couldn't move my neck the day after. 

I've been to a few courses in order to learn how to maintain a *healthy back* on a daily basis. Learned about proper exercises to strengthen my core and weak side, and stretches to relieve pain and align my curvature. This was one of the best things I've done since finding out I had this thing called Scoliosis!
But, although I manage to live a normal, healthy life, I always hit the same bump in the road when I start getting into sports again. Even though I use insoles to level my uneven legs and do all the stretches and breathing exercises I know, I never really get to progress to a point where I can do regular exercise - **swimming and surfing for example**, without going through a couple of days of recovery, massages and stretches every day.

Now, what I would like to know is **how you manage** to do any kind of sports (or intense physical activity), and keep a pain/discomfort free back. I've put together a quick form to gather some information, tips &amp; tricks of how any one of you do it...be it a regular jog in the park or pro athlete level, all input is welcome.

The initial goal was just to help me get better at maintaining a sporty lifestyle, but depending on the feedback I would love to put together a little archive with advices for both general active lifestyle and specific sports with scoliosis.

Let me know what you think, can't wait to hear from all of you, I've also set up [a little questionnaire](https://joosantos4.typeform.com/to/t4SYqC), if you have a few minutes I appreciate the input!

The CT scan showed diminished space, instability and arthritis at previous surgery site.   I saw an orthopedic surgeon who said I should not have fusion surgery because of the chances it may not help and scar tissue can cause issues.

I have tried many conservative treatments. Every time I try to exercise and strengthen eventually I end up hurting something and end up back where I started.  This seems like good advice after researching the outcomes for this statistically are not great. I'm starting to look at options out side of Canada.  Two have stood out.

Laser spine institute: boasts minimally invasive surgeries that do not damage muscles.

Balanced back total disc replacement: boasts complete bone and disc replacement.

Both of these have patient testimonials and seem great but are costly and I worry about it being a scam.  There are other surgeons outside of my province and in the states that try minimally invasive techniques.  As well as pain rehabilitation centers that I do not have access to here but do not know where would be best to go.

343,Shoulder Pain For 6 Months (PT Didn't Help),"I've had back pain for about 6 months now and have been in physical therapy for 3 months and done the designated exercises.

Backstory: 
I used to workout very regulary weekly about 3-4 times a week. Suddenly, about 6 months ago I was on summer break from college I picked up a couple warehouse jobs so I'm not sure if this is related to that but all of sudden I had the urge to always pull my shoulders back thinking it had to do with fixing my posture. However, I began to have a nagging more like unconformtability in my left shoulder. I can't remember the medical term, however, I was diagnosed with a shoulder blade that rests higher than my other shoulder so it works harder than the other one and it is always tight. The physical therapy exercises aren't quite working for me and have lacked the desire to go to the gym for the last few months because it began to get inflamed the next day everytime I would do back day and extremely uncomfortable to continue readjusting my  shoulder by pulling it back. I don't know what to do besides possibly continue doing the exercises at home and work on core. Any other suggestions would be much appreciated because I'd like to resume going to the gym and my regular lifts as well as just have this nagging pain go away for good.

So id like to have someone take a look and provide potential remedies. My trainer mentioned trying chiropractors, but on my original injury, that did absolutely nothing.

350,Cervical Spine Issues - 3 Events,"Hello!

I'm desperately trying to see what is covered under my medical and get an appointment, but everyone is 3-4 weeks out for an appointment.

I've been a long-time sports enthusiast (snowboarding, kayaking, soccer, basketball, tennis). I'm also a developer who spends 6-7 hours a day at a desk. I'm 29 years old.

Within the past 2-3 years I've had 3 events that have caused me really bad back pain. Once I was snowboarding, another time I was Kayaking (whitewater), and another time I was lifting weights. None of the events were particularly violent or anything. Just typical movements and all of a sudden I feel a sharp pain in my back and its hard to move my head in any direction.

The pain seems to be stemming from the 4th, 5th, and 6th vertebrae that I can feel on with my hand. Leading up to the event I can feel some slight discomfort in my upper back/neck and get a popping noise out of my neck if I try to touch my ear to my shoulder - that kind of movement.

I have a really sore back and limited range of motion for a week and the pain slowly subsides weeks later. I can't turn my head all the way. When I turn to the right I feel pain in my upper back near where the injury occurs. If I turn to the left I feel pain as well, but it's very centered in what feels like a muscle just to the left of my shoulder around the 4th-6th vertebrae down (that I can feel with my hands). Up and down movement of my head heals quicker than side to side.

Let me know if I can provide any more helpful information!

358,Lower Back Pain - help with diagnosis,"So I've had lower back pain which has gradually increased over the last 7-8 years, no accidents or anything.  I thought I'd post a list of symptoms here in case anyone has similar ones and has been diagnosed with something more specific than ""mechanical back pain"".

* Pain in lower back, roughly from the base of the spine to halfway up
* Pain is more towards the ""sharp"" end of the scale than ""aching""
* Pain is worst when I wake up, after I've walked / stood up for a while, or a while (say 15-20 minutes) after doing heavy lifting, but is more or less constant the rest of the time.
* Feels to me like my vertebrae are all squished up - like I want to be a couple of inches taller
* If I lie over the edge of the bed (on my front) and stretch the spine, it gives relief (whilst simultaneously hurting, but it's  a ""good"" pain if you see what I mean).  Afterwards, I feel fragile, like if I moved too quickly it would really hurt.
* If I lie on my back and twist my hips it is somewhat relieving.  It also crunches each time I twist (sometimes it's one crunch sound, sometimes it's multiple, and I can feel the vertebrae slipping over one another when it happens)
* Occasionally I get sore muscles if I stretch too much, but the nature of the muscle pain is very different
* I've tried:
   - Amitriptyline (makes me sleepy, provides no pain relief)
   - Pregabalin (makes me feel high, provides very slight pain relief in high doses)
   - Codeine (45-60mg mostly dispels the pain for a few hours, but I don't really want an opiate addicition)
   - Cannabis (provides a distraction from the pain, but no actual pain relief)

My posture's never been great and I probably have a somewhat lower than average calcium intake, which makes me think it could be skeletal in nature.

I've been to the doctor many times, and had a couple of courses of physio, neither of which helped.  I'm posting here as a last resort, rather than a first attempt.

366,Found an exercise that triggers my back soreness. Should I do more of it?,"I'm recovering from a car accident about 3 years ago. My back is almost fine, but it aches just a bit in a way that I know it's not quite ok.

It feels like a muscle in my lower back (a PT said my QL, could be a spinal erector) is chronically tight.

The exercise is a [Landmine Rainbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZiiRID_Zmg). Most other exercises, even heavy deadlifts, don't make it feel any different, but those really hit it.

My instincts tell me to do high volume, low weight regularly to strengthen the muscle, and maybe it will finally relax, but I've also heard a tight muscle like that usually means nearby muscles are weak, so focusing on those would be better.

Or I could stretch more, but QL stretches are annoying, and I've been lazy with them.

Probably should mention I'm halfway physically active, and I've been though over regular yoga sessions since the injury. Overtraining and not giving my back a chance to heal is a real possibility too.",

I'm about three months into a bulging L4/5 that's hitting a nerve, and I've been trying everything I can think of aside from surgery - PT, chiro, sports massage, dry needling, Muscle Activation Technique (MAT). While I generally feel pretty good, I teach and train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (it's like wrestling), which is a very flexion-heavy activity, and even training/drilling very light produces nerve pain.

I happened upon Dr. McGill's work, picked up Back Mechanic, and have been doing the Big 3 religiously, along with revising everything else about how I sit, stand, get out of bed, off the toilet, etc., to be in line with what the book advises. Again, I generally feel pretty good, but my main goal is to get back to BJJ, and I'm disappointed that even light BJJ-related movement still produces nerve discomfort. 

You could say the purpose of this post is two-fold:

-To provide me a platform to complain as I sit here, with great posture, yet still in mild discomfort, feeling like I'm never going to be able to fully get back to my favorite activity in the world

-More importantly, to ask other active people/athletes who have experienced similar symptoms to share their stories and (hopefully) recovery using Dr. McGill's teachings

If this has already been done in another post on r/backpain, please feel free to point me to it, but I didn't see it if so.",
372,Neuromuscular Therapy for back pain,"I have been very successful working to relieve back pain using a technique called - Neuromuscular Therapy. When I was in IT I developed severe pain in my low back and hips. In seeking a solution I found Neuromuscular Therapy, it helped me so much I left my job in IT and became a practitioner. I don't make as much but the work I do is super rewarding. My practice is in San Francisco and I am always happy to answer questions. I offer free 30 minute sessions so people can come in to feel if what I offer is right for them. My website is here - canmt.com

I can't give specific advice over the internet and if you are in pain you should go and see your Dr first.

There are a lot of reasons for back pain one of the most common that I see in my practice comes from sitting to much. The hip flexors (psoas and illiacus muscles) get tight and stay tight and over time put undue strain on the lumbar spine and distort the lordotic curve. The upper body shifts back to compensate which increases the imbalance in the lower back. Many people who sit at a computer all day crane their head forward which distorts the cervical spine (neck) causing headaches and neck and upper back ache. The Neuromuscular Therapy that I practice addresses these imbalances by breaking up the held tension patterns and allowing the body to come back to a more neutral position. Along with the soft tissue work I address perpetuating factors with clients and offer simple self care ideas that help to keep tension from coming back.

There are three parts for lasting relief-

1. Soft tissue work - release of the holding patterns suck in the soft tissue breakup  fascial adhesions and release trigger points

2. Education - guided self awareness exercises, anatomy review

3. Simple self care exercises that help to relieve tension held in the body

I hope that this helps. There are Neuromuscular Therapists all around the country it just isn't as well know as other therapies.",

380,How is my lower back? / MRI translation needed,"Brief history - about 16 years ago (at 26 years old) had bad lower back pain for a few months with sciatica on the back of my left leg.  Went to a back doctor and got an x-ray done, here is his diagnosis:

1. Disc Degeneration Disease

2. Retrolysthesis on L4-5?  I don't remember the exact vertibrate.

Went to 2 different Physical Therapists and it did not help - finally the back pain went away on its own about 8 months later.

.

Throughout the years I would get some back pain every 2-3 months and it would last about 2 weeks.

Sometimes its my lower back muscle (this is usually more soreness and pain associated with stiffness).  

Sometimes its my ""spine"" - I feel the pain coming from my spine rather than my muscle and for example if I sit and totally relax my body (dead weight) I feel like someone stabbed me in the spine.  And I sometimes get a shooting pain into my testicles.

.

Finally went back to the doctor last month and he ordered a MRI, this is the test results (have not been able to go back to the doctor):

.

Impression:  A transitional lumbosacral segment is referred to as S1:

1. Midline posterior disc herniation at L4-L5

2. Marked disc space narrowing at L5-S1 associated with a posterior disc-osteophyte complex encroaching upon the canal and neural foramina, left more than right
.

Can someone translate that into layman's english.

How is my lower back? (in your opinion, which I understand is just a internet opinion based off a short post with no examination)

I didn't think my lower back was that bad, yes I get back pain, but it only lasts for 2 weeks and its about every 2-3 months so its not that constant.  

But the report sounds kind of bad.  (I do know that just because there is a disc issue does not mean there will be pain.  I know people can have herniations without symptoms)

That said, I am surprised at the herniation.  I didnt think I would have one, I thought perhaps a bulge at most.


Thank you!

384,Stretch helps lower back pain - Great video,,
385,lower back pain and in both thighs (18 yrs old),"About 3 - 4  years ago when i was 14/15 i had 6 lumbar punctures (unrelated to back pain) which were done all in the same day as they couldn’t get it in the right place.
Since then i’ve had lower back pain on and off, which i presumed was normal at first (they did say i would need physiotherapy however i was never given it).

Recently (about 6 months ago) the pain has been excruciating, and has spread down into both of my thighs. It results in me not being able to sit, lay or stand for any longer than 5 - 10 minutes without being in a great amount of pain. 

I have been to the doctors who just gave me Co-codamol and naproxen and sent me on my way and also to a physiotherapist who just told me to do Pelvic tilts until she can next see me (in about another 2 months). Neither of these two things have helped and i’m not sure what to do next.

The physiotherapist said she didn’t think the lumbar punctures solely caused the pain, however it may have triggered it. 

Any idea what might be going on here? Or what i can do to help with the pain?

388,Ugh...it feels so permanent sometimes. Like i will never win,"Ive had back pain off and on for years. It started in one spot, i learned about stretching , got a lot better, then went away for years. Then a different pain on a different side started around 3 years ago. 

Its been off and on...and I have strung together some really good months at times, but it seems to get reirritated. 
This last string sort of came up after living with some relatives and helping them lift a handicapped son into bed at night. Its on me....I kept going when i shouldn't have...I wanted to get stronger and pushed myself. 

I feel like i was using good posture, but there was sort of a swinging at the hips i did to lower him into bed...and that last moment of laying him down there was strain on my lower back pelvic region. So it flared up on me. 

Lower left side...It feels very sharp and pinpoint at times, I believe it is SI related ...or spine related...like disc issue. I dunno. 

I saw a chiropractor, got a sacro belt, and it has helped. But lately I was moving back home, and rearranging my old room, cleaning, moving things...from morning to night, staying too busy i guess. And it has flared up. 

Its just so damn frustrating. I stretch, I try to not sit much...try to lay or stand...Stay active, go on walks. And on certain days it just gets me down. 

I dont have health insurance either....and by the looks of it, its either too late...or too expensive at this point. But damn i was ready to spend what little savings i had on a few appointments w a specialist if i could get a decent insurance rate. All i can find is 300 range. Sucks. 

Being unemployed isnt helping but I was trying to complete a project related to self employment, but this back pain flares up and i feel helpless. Sucks.

I just hate it, Im 31 and have this pain...its been hanging around popping up a lot , about once a week a flare up....for over a month now. ugh. But my chiro said to wear this sacro belt for 3 months so i am hoping shit improves. I defintely need to not be lifting and moving shit right now. 


I guess its just depressing at times when it feels like it wont improve. I start to worry it will never improve...and then all the anxiety about not being about to see a back doctor because of insurance...and my financial pressures. Ugh.


But i have been here before (which maybe shouldnt be so comforting) and Its been worse. the pain. I have had to crawl on my hands to get around for 3 days about 2 years ago. And it gets better. Its been worse and its gotten so good that i could do some light jogging. SO i am hoping this time is no different. And it will heal",
389,3-week Uncertainty,"Hi all.
First time at the sub, and didn't really understand the trouble of back pain until recently. :)

I'll give a brief summary;

17M. Been playing badminton and cycling a little for several years, also spent 3 months at the gym last summer (2017).
I haven't been phyiscally active much at all since September 2017, and recently took 2 10-minute cycles to and from a place in town.

The pain started the next morning. I can actually point out the area where the pain is. [the Thorocumbular Fascia and to a similar extent the Iliac Crest](https://haydenperno.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lower-back.png) are the areas causing trouble.

I thought it was just a simple pull that we all occasionaly get. I slept it off for a couple of weeks and it hasn't really gotten any better. It was mostly gone yesterday, but stronger again today.

The pain is always there, but increases moderately when sitting (as I am now, typing), and doing light walking and twisting. It increases more when bending and sitting up. It's hard putting socks on in the morning. XD

There is no pain when the area is touched, in any way - be it a little massage or digging in knuckles.

Any idea what the problem is? I'm probably going to a doctor next week but I don't think they'll know what the problem is - and send me on through scan-after-scan.

Thanks. :D

2 years ago out of nowhere I woke up one day with bad sciatic pain down my right leg and couldn’t walk, after numerous doctor appointments and a MRI they said it was just sciatica and I had a slight slipped disk but it was so minimal that that wouldn’t have been causing the pain, after months of no improvement I saw a chiropractor who sorted me out after a few sessions, he said I was hypermobile and my lower back bones and joints slipped out of place easy and my back was out of alignment so I had to have them set in all place again. I would only be pain free for a few weeks before a bone would slip out again and I’d need treatment because of the lower back pain and nerve pain. After a year of this I then had other issues such as drop foot, my right leg became shorter, I lost all muscle In my right leg and glute and my hip bone dropped 2 inches down.

It's like a dull, burning ache, which causes me pain all day, and wakes me and keeps me up at night. It hurts to cough, bend forward, and lift my hips up. Ibuprofen and massages help temporarily, but time is not making the pain dissipate. The doctor thinks it is sciatic pain, but I am not sure. 

Anyone have a similar experience? I really cannot find a comfortable way to sleep, even with pillows. :( ",
394,Anyone have similar symptoms?,"For the last month I have been feeling chest tightness and aches around my left shoulder blade area. My left rib cage has flared up at moments when the pain is stronger. The aches aren’t terrible, but it’s significant enough to notice and annoying. 

Also, recently, I have been feeling small cracks and pops in my neck area near my scapula when I take a deep breathe. Sometimes I can feel them every 2-3 minutes for a few hours and other times I don’t feel them at all. I feel the inflammation in my neck and shoulder area when it does crack on deep breathes. There is no pain with the cracks but only a sense of relief. 

Other symptoms include rib tenderness, sternum pressure. It just feels weird like my ribs might have moved out of place. 

I went to the ER the other day and all my vitals were ok. Any suggestions on what exactly this may be? 

Edit: I’ve had this bone deformity on my left side of my chest. The rib 2nd or 3rd rib bone near my nipple protrudes just a little.

395,Undiagnosed back pain,"I've had back pain for several years now. In the early stages, I saw all sorts of professionals from osteopaths, physios and chiropractors. I also had an MRI scan which showed no sign of disc problems. 

I put the pain aside after this and continued with my sport (rowing), although it was very stop start due to the back injury.

More recently, I have not been able to do any form of training or physical exercise so have decided to try and get it sorted. Problem is, I'm not sure I know what it is.

The physio thinks it is disc related although my MRI in 2013 suggests not. I thought it was muscular, perhaps a QL strain, however my physio suggests if it were, it would have healed or at least eased off with the amount of pain I'm having. 

It's always the lower right side. It's tender to put a lot of pressure on the muscle where the QL runs along, and generally uncomfortable all the time. I've had pain/spasms in the glute/piriformis which has led to small signs of sciatica. 

Massage and stretching relieve it, but the pain comes back after a while. After two months of physio and assessments, the physio is still inclined to think it is disc related.

396,Mystery back pain,"Hello everyone! 
I am having some difficulties and since I currently am uninsured, I thought I would post here for advice.
Back in 2007, I began having lower back pain (doing things like hiking would be unbearable, especially after laying down and sleeping after a day of hiking through the woods). I had an X-ray, and my doc suspected sacroiliitis. Never began treatment, was recommended physical therapy.
I lost my insurance shortly thereafter, and about two years ago I went to another doctor. He tested me for Ankylosing spondylitis, which was negative. X-rays were negative, and he ordered an MRI (no contrast), which came up negative.  I then went through some physical therapy, and after finishing was told to see an Ortho since the pain wasn’t changing.  Well, I lost my insurance again and haven’t seen anyone about it since, and have basically been planning my activities/days around my back pain.
I read about inversion therapy and was anxious to try it, and purchased a yoga trapeze.  It seemed to be working, and I used it for about two weeks and then stopped due to not being able to hang it up...
It felt great, but every time I used it I would feel a grinding sensation and then have some pain and a warm feeling where it usually hurts, and then some increased mobility.
Now, after not having used it for a bit, I went to my bro-in-law’s house for Christmas... and guess what? He has an inversion table!
Well I tried it (slowly) and felt immediate relief while almost upside-down, but as soon as I was almost upright again, I had unbearable sharp pains and couldn’t lean forward enough to undo the things that hold your ankles in. I stayed upright for about an hour after, and then we had to go.  I have unbearable pain that radiates through my left hip, and I cannot bend forward without support. It’s like I lean forward a little and my back just gives out.
I stayed in bed for about two days and am at work now - it is very difficult to walk, and uncomfortable to sit upright. Doing things like putting on shoes and pants is very difficult, and kind of a more intense pain than what I typically experience.
Please if anyone has experience with something like this, or is knowledgeable about back pain, please let me know what I can do now before I’m able to see a doc again.  I’m thinking it will be probably another 2 months before I have insurance again.
I’ll answer any questions specific to the type of pain and duration of that helps.

Since the pop, I've had slight pain in some positions and stiffness. It's somewhat painful to bend over with a rounded back. If I want to pick something up from the ground, I have to squat down with a straight back. I believe I feel stiffness in my lower back muscle rather than my spine.

The complete onset of pain takes about 2-6 hours and will vary in severity but am usually completely immobile for the next 2 to 4 days (bed pan immobile).

Once I am able to move again, I have an incredibly noticeable right-leaning tilt and radiating pain down both of my legs but predominantely my left. This pain is down the middle top of my thigh and excruciates down to the knee. These residual effects last anywhere from 7-21 days and are visible in my gait. I also experience pain in my left front shoulder, however this is more recent with the past 2-3 pain episodes I have had.

Additional residual effects I have noticed are that my right knee drops when I walk, this happens a few times a day and is seen as a small dip in my gait. 

After an x-ray this week I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis and completely disagree with the diagnosis. I don't think a degenerative diagnosis is appropriate considering the pattern of my pain has been exactly the same for the past 16 years. I believe it is a herniated disc. The reason I believe this is because everyone in my family on my dad's side has an L5-S1 herniated disc. My father, my grandfather, both of my uncles, my aunt, and my identical twin brother. The onset and disappearance of my pain, the nerve radiation, and other symptoms does not sound like a degenerative disease.

Is this normal getting used to a new mattress without a big indent in it or is it because its a low quality mattress?",

I have pain in my lower back. I can only stand, walk or sit down for until I start feeling pain. It has been 3 months since I've dealt with this new transition...I have been on bed rest for 3 months...I am pretty much a beached whale. I feel SO SO SO bored just laying in bed all day

I recently got the results back from my MRI and it turned out being NEGATIVE, meaning they can't see anything on the scan......I just feel so hopeless.

416,Back pain after sleeping 4-6 hours,"I sleep on my sides, I can sleep on my back, but prefer not to. I've slept the same way for over 7 years. Out of no where, I started to wake up, after sleeping for 4-6 hours, with mid back pain. It's right below where my bra sits and extends from one side of my back all the way across to the other side. If I get up out of bed, the pain goes away immediately. If I lay back down, it comes back. If I stay out of bed for 15-20 minutes, I can sleep again without pain.

I went to the doctor, he gave me gabapentin thinking it was nerve pain, and sent me to physical therapy. Gabapentin knocks me out, and I'm able to sleep about 6 hours before it wears off, but then I wake up with back pain at that point. I did PT for 10 weeks with zero improvement. I told the doctor about only being able to sleep 6 hours before waking up again, and he suggested I increase the dose. That's fine, but that doesn't fix the problem. I don't want to take this medication forever. 

Over the counter pain relievers, like Motrin, do nothing for the pain. I've tried waiting up at 3-4am, taking Motrin and going back to sleep, but I just wake up at the normal 4-6 hour mark of when the pain sets in.

I also want to mention that this pain started about 4 months ago. After having it for about a month, we had a hurricane. I had to sleep in various beds as we had no power at our house, none of the beds changed how long I could sleep. We also just bought a new bed, and have been sleeping on it a week, but again, no change in how I feel. I still wake up in pain. So I don't think it's the bed.

I've tried sleeping on my back when I wake up with the pain, but it's still there. I've tried stretching while in bed to see if there is a specific position that will stop the pain. The closest I can get to relief is if I curl up in the fetal position, the pain is not as intense, but it's still there.

I have an MRI scheduled, but it's not for a while. I'm wondering if anyone one else has had something similar and what you did to help the pain. Or if anyone has any other suggestions.",

419,"Pinched nerve, wondering what the next step is","Hi! 

Backstory: Long time neck/shoulder pain sufferer which usually just morphs in to migraines and general soreness/tightness in that area (also had an X-ray earlier this year of my neck which showed it was too straight). That's been happening for years, been getting bodywork done, I do yoga when I can, I'm aware of good posture practices, and I'm starting acupuncture Friday. 

Two nights ago I woke up to the loudest crack/pop coming from inside my body followed by immediate searing pain in my left shoulder, left arm, and neck. It was impossible to move. Next day went to convenient care and noticed my left arm was going numb/tingling and parts of my face were going numb/tingling. Doc said it was probably a pinched nerve, gave me muscle relaxers and naproxen. Today the soreness is def less but the nerve pain is worse. My shoulder and arm are on fire, my pinky and ring finger feel so weird, my arm keeps twitching and if it's in any position other than straight down my whole arm and hand start convulsing like crazy. I'm starting to feel some nerve pain in my right bicep, and my nose and surrounding area are numb/tingling. 

For those of you that have had anything similar, what's the best next step? Doc recommended two weeks of meds and if there's no improvement to come back, but since they were a convenient care doc I want to make sure that's the best move. There have been a lot of times in my life where I thought ""wow, wish I would have known that sooner"" so any thoughts/experiences that might help are much appreciated. ",

Exercised more, walked more, stretched more, only got worse.

Just saw a chiropractor yesterday. She took x-rays. I go back tomorrow to discuss the results and hopefully get treatment.

This might be caused by constipation due to my ulcerative proctitis.

I work in a cybersecurity call center and sit in a chair all day. It hurts to sit, stand, walk, and lay down. Basically, it's always hurting. 

I'm taking 2-3 ibuprofen a day, 10mg water soluble CBD in a glass of water twice a day, periodic use of CBD vape pen.

Any advice on how to deal with this? I've read that once my constipation goes away, it will take some time for the nerves to heal. Step one is making my constipation go away, and there are things you can do (coffee) that aren't good for ulcerative proctitis (caffeine).

422,Has Anyone On This Sub Had a Lumbar Spinal Fusion?,"Hey guys. I'm a 24F contemplating a two-level lumbar fusion from L4-S1. I have been in severe pain, that has been worsening, for the past year, due to Degenerative Disc Disease and Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome. I had one surgery back in June to remove a herniated disc at L4-L5. Since then, my disc pain has increased significantly, and has become extremely debilitating. I now have multiple surgeons recommending the fusion, which says a lot, I think, being that I am far younger than most who have to go through this.

I guess my question is this: For those who've had the surgery,  was it worth it? Why/Why not? How long before you were back up on your feet (I know the full healing time takes quite a while, but I am curious to know about how long, realistically, it will take me to start walking again)? Please feel free to share any and all knowledge on this matter! I'm feeling very stuck. Thanks in advance!",
423,Chronic back/shoulder pain,"So I've been having upper back pain for the last 5 years that seems to have expanded into the shoulder, mostly on the right side.  My regular family doctor sent me for X-rays and didn't see much, but I also had an MRI in Feb of '16.  He said it didn't really find much of note.  So started seeing a new massage therapist who works out of a physio clinic and after a few sessions she suggested I see a doctor that worked out of the clinic there.  Had an appointment last week, he looks at my previous MRI results, and says he does find some items concerning.  Here's the results he was concerned about.

""At C3-4 there is mild loss of disc height with a small posterior disc/osteophyte complex to the right of the midline. This causes mild effacement of the ventral thecal sac but no cord compression or foraminal stenosis.

At C4-5 t here i mild loss of disc height with a small posterior disc/osteophyte complex on the left.  Again there is mild effacement of the ventral tecal sac.  The disc margin contacts the ventral spinal cord with slight cord compression.  Central canal and foramina are patent.""

While it's tough for me to make sense of all this, he says it can be causing my issues and has suggested trying a cortisone injection at C4-5.  Any thoughts or advice on this?  Any insight? Would the cortisone be worth trying?  I'm a 38 year old dude.

* General lower back stiffness and occasional pain
* Difficulty straightening back up after prolonged periods of sitting... Feel like my back literally can't do it right away....
* prolonged periods of standing makes my lower back hurt or feel sore

I had an L2 compression fracture that was stable and no spinal damage almost a year ago. The bone healed within a few months, but I still have periodic lower back pain today. When I'm active I either don't notice the pain, or perhaps it goes away. When I sit around a lot, I do notice. I also notice my whole back often being tight. I'm not sure if  the pain is due to my core being weak, or if it's remnant of my injury. I'm scared of the latter because I don't to experience this for the rest of my life. I did PT for a month but I'm not sure if it helped much.

429,"Back Pain, No End in Site. Need Advice.","Long story short. No Dr. knows exactly what is causing my pain. In fact, when I pressed my current Dr. I was told ""Why does it even matter whats causing it"". Drs in my area are terrible. .

I have had the pain for the past 3 years. I'm 32 years old.

My pain is a bit odd in that it switches from one side to the other about every day. By this I mean that pain experienced on one side means I experience no pain on the other. The pain is severe to the point where I can't concentrate on normal daily activities. The pain radiates down my leg, sometimes to my shin. The pain is constant, 24 7.

Normal range of motion tests don't seem to make the pain any worse.

Very mild Osteoarthritis was identified around my l5 and s1 area. This only showed on my most recent MRI, nothing showed up in my previous MRI. From the research I've done it could very well be something else that is causing the OA. And mild OA often does not exhibit symptoms.

The pain began shortly after a mild car accident (rear end less than 15 mph I would guess).

Physical therapy has a mild positive effect, if any. Steroidal Epidural Injections have almost no effect, although they may reduce the radiating pain. Often stretching or getting up and walking will dampen the pain for about 30 minutes or so. Gabapentin allows me to sleep some nights (but not this one!)

Does anyone have any idea what this could be? Has anyone had something similar? Any advice on treatment? Is there a hub where I can research Drs? (I'm willing to travel)

I've never felt more hopeless than I am now. I'm the sole provider for a wife and 3 kids, so it is so very important I fight this. I certainly don't have support from the medical professionals in my area. Any help/advice would be very appreciated.",

All of my basis is regarding the state of Florida and may vary depending where you are. If further proof is required moderators please message me.



Benefits of seeing a...

Chiropractor: typically useful in a diagnosis such as scoliosis, whiplash or general out of alignment diagnosis. 
Most chiropractors are good at “cracking” your joints moving them into proper alignment which feels good temporarily. They are very controversial for a few reasons, they have little to no insurance funding so most of their income is from lawsuits of car accidents etc and they advertise specifically for back pain such as whiplash for that reason. There are good and bad chiropractors, also some of them have cool and unique tools such as cupping, physical therapy, traction machines, trigger point release equipment.. etc. these all have a specific goal and can be very beneficial for you if you have that specific problem. How to tell if one is good if your inexperienced is usually going by ratings and word of mouth, you can tell by how much they try to keep you in the facility and shun you away from other medical professionals, also if they “ crack “your bones they will come back to the spot they were and need to be cracked again unless you do something to keep them there such as physical therapy or home exercise.. if they don’t inform you of this they are probably just wanting the reoccurring lawsuit patient for funds. 

Physical therapist: there is infinite reasons to see a pt, you could really argue that any disease/diagnosis  ever has a reason for pt. It boils down to this: how is It beneficial for me ? Post surgical will definitely need pt. Those muscles atrophy or are sometimes cut and you will Benefit in some way no matter what. Most of these protocols can be found online for generalized time frame of when you will heal. For non surgical you need to find a therapist that fits your specific needs, too many times have I heard of someone who does home health ( treating grandmas all day) and doesn’t know how to treat a high school athlete. I have also seen too many “sports therapy” clinics who use the name to get a younger population but have never treated any athletes. Make sure your therapist has credentials toward your injury, and will fight for you. There are some clinics that work like little caesers pizza and literally just move people through giving them ten minutes of ice, ten minutes of heat, and 40 minutes of stupid treatments. These are terrible, make sure your isolating your problem and working on It ( ice and heat can be beneficial at times ) how to tell if your therapist is good is usually by watching how they treat the other clientele that are there. Back pain may need a back pain specialist, there are a ton of good clinics out there but they are usually specialized and will have It in the name. Each exercise should have a purpose, and if your therapist is unfit most likely they don’t practice what they preach and will not do the best job ( again this is generalized there are some amazing ones that are unfit ).

Ortho spine surgeon vs neurosurgeon: neuro surgeons deal with the spine, brain, and all nerves in the body. If I had to consult for a neurological surgery like a herniated disc or a cyst I would personally chose a neuro surgeon, ortho would be someone to fix a compression fracture etc. these can usually be used interchangeably and if I had to pick which to go to I would go based off of ratings and word of mouth. Be careful a lot of them will have 5 stars but will not do a five star job, the best way to figure out how they really do is to ask their patients or call therapy clinics and ask how the patients do after surgery( unfortunately most will fakely say they do well because of fear that they will lose a referral from that doctor ). Don’t get surgery unless you’ve expanded all other options and nothing is working. If a doctor advises you otherwise they don’t care about you, an exception would be if your about to be paralyzed due to the severity of a herniation, this doesn’t happen often. 

Anesthesiologist / pain management: anesthiologist will usually be the ones to perform an epidural, which can take your pain away temporarily, permanently, or not at all. Regardless It is necessary to be performed before surgery. The epidural also has the potential to remove scar tissue after surgery, but so does medication like gaba pentin. If you are taking prescription drugs, This is usually ideal for a short period of time only, if you have long term pain management It is because you are intentionally avoiding surgery and are okay with being on a drug for a long period of time. In my advice avoid the drugs because they don’t help with nerve pain anyway. These people will usually be referred after seeing your neurologist/ortho or primary doc, I would not seek them out unless specifically needed, and after mentioning to your doc that you do not want long term medications as an option.

Most people will want an mri to confirm a diagnosis, this is normal-necessary by insurance  and can be good. However almost everyone has a disc bulge or herniation and often doctors will immediately point to this as the problem when It could be asymptomatic... be careful of this !!!

Hope this helps, feel free to comment with your questions or input.

This pain is most easily felt when I stretch by pushing my check out and pulling my arms and head back.  The pain also seems to slightly radiate to the surrounding ribs.  

Today I still have the muscle soreness, but what concerns me is the ache in my upper spine.  The pain is worsened by sitting or standing for too long.  It's worse with lifting, especially throwing up and catching my nephew. I get jolts of pain as I catch any sort of weight. I have pinpoint tenderness on a couple of vertebrae, a bruised type feeling. If I put any weight on that area, like leaning on a wall, it aches quite badly.

I have been to a GP who said it was my rhomboids and prescribed PT which I did for two months. I continue to use the stretching techniques they taught me, with no results.  I would like to see a specialist but I'm not sure what kind, I'm looking for a diagnosis so that I can better approach the issue.

I have had two MRIs since I last posted here and they confirm that there is a paracentral disc bulge at L5-S1. Other notes were that there is severe disc degeneration in my lower lumbar spine. Since my first MRI I have been doing McKenzie prone extension exercises, however, at my second MRI (~3 months after the first) they confirmed there had been no change in severity of the bulging of the disc, furthermore, my pain and mobility had increased and decreased respectively - the exercises seemingly haven't helped.  In conclusion, I am unsure if this disc bulge is somewhat of a red herring!

What I have noticed for some time, and the Doctors and Physiotherapists just seemingly ignore, is: I get severe pain (in back, glute and down my leg) when lying prone and lifting my right leg and internally rotating it (if I externally rotate the leg I get pain relief), pain is exacerbated by adducting the right leg across the body.

**2 Tennisballs in a sock to roll and loosen your tight muscles around ur spine** - For me, releases pain and gives more mobility.

**Chin ups with palms facing forward, not too narrow grip, legs pretty much forward and go up until you feel the squeeze at mid-back** - Overall back strength.

457,Cervical vertebrae out of place for a year: any advice?,"Hi! I need some advice. Has anyone here ever had a cervical vertebrae dislocated, that is, moved out of is place (nothing broken)? 

That's been my situation with the C7 vertebrae for the past year or so. I'm 31 btw. It all started with a silly shoulder movement, no accidents or anything. I've been to different health professionals, including two physiotherapists and two osteopaths with slow and gradual improvements with exercises and manual therapy followed by sudden worsening due to the vertebrae suddenly sliding further out of place for a reason or another. 

Right now, I'm seeing an osteopath once a week, having slow progress again, but I can't help wondering if there isn't an easier way of doing this? It has tremendous impact in my life quality because it affects my blood circulation and I can't help feeling there must be some other kind of professional I could be seeing to make this faster. Any thoughts?:) ",

459,Pain by shoulder blade - causing flu like symptoms,"Has anyone else had this happen to them? Perhaps I am just getting sick and it's all a coincidence. The other night, I went to pick up one of my kids, and felt a little tingling in my right shoulder blade, close to my spine. I immediately stopped what I was doing and started to apply heat and cold. I went to my chiropractor yesterday - he said it was a rib out of place. He did some big adjustments and it felt great after wards. However, I still have some lingering muscle pain (which is to be expected), but I seem to have a high resting heart rate (I wear a Fitbit to monitor). Typically my resting heart rate is around 57 - 58. Right now it's at 70. Which leads me to believe that I *am* getting sick, or the pain has just made my body go into fix mode.",
460,Would seeing spine ortho be worthwhile?,"I’m 22. In July I was diagnosed with a stress fracture on L5. I saw a non operative sports medicine doctor who had me rest for 12 weeks and prescribed PT after 5 weeks. 

I went to PT once and I was told that all they could do for me was back massages they will not touch my joint. I said hell no to PT, $65 per visit 3x weekly. Can’t afford it! 

I’m now many weeks past 12 weeks and I still feel bad. I have the fracture ache from time to time. I bend over like I’m 60. I have muscle spasms here and there especially when I lay down. Sometimes my hip is affected in all of this too. 

I’ve never had an mri. Disc damage or nerve problems were never excluded. I only had a CT and X-rays. Sports medicine says there’s really nothing anyone can do. I’ve kind of accepted my back is done for.

465,pain during flexion,"Background: 2 back injuries
1. Caused by someone who was trying to help me stretch, don't know what happened (didn't have health insurance and never went to doctor) but I walked out of his office feeling fine, couldn't walk that night or for the next week. Over a year to feel better from that. 5 years ago.
2. Back extension machine at the gym. Immediate pain, this happened over a year ago but is ongoing and is the precursor for this current ailment.
No doctor or professional diagnosis for either injury.

I have a LOT of pain during lumbar flexion. I have difficulty doing exercises like hollow-hold, dead-bugs, any kind of laying-on-the-ground ab work that requires you to get your lower back flat on the ground. This action, the pressing my back into the ground (slightly rounding the lumbar spine) really hurts. Same pain happens while standing if I squeeze my glutes and try to bend over at the lower back. 
I have become pretty good at avoiding these movements but want to know if anyone else has similar symptoms and what sorts of core exercises worked for them. Everything I read/watch says that laying down ab exercises can really hurt the low back if you do not press your low back flat on the floor, but since I really cannot do that I was hoping to find other options.

They have stopped asking me to lift things, and realize whats going on. But i start thinking in my head they dont give a shit , yada yada.

Now my S.I. joint is bothering every day, although improving and the pain is light....just feeling super resentful right now and angry. Of course  then when i was feeling healthy i was ready to jump in and help out w things, and even the next time i wasnt in a ton of pain so agreed to help out. 

But you know how things can be around relatives, feeling obligated and that kind of thing. But i know its bullshit. Its on me....ive got to be the one to say NO. Ive got to be the one to protect my back and draw the line. 

Ive brought up the pain more and more now, and they seem to be helpful, or acting so. Giving my advice and telling my not to lift things. But its the looking back on it...that pisses me off. I know am just stewing in my own version of it....but i havent been angry yet so im doing it now i guess.

I've just about tried every practice, been to Chiropractors over 20 times, Physio well over 30 times, seen a Sport and spine specialist, a sport specialist. Had me on antidepressant drugs to see if it was a nerve playing up said that after 2weeks of taking them I should feel improvements, but didn't help. I've had all tests blood test, urine test, MRI, X-rays and everything comes back clear no issues.

I don't want to go through my whole life with this pain, I know there's definitely people in worse situations but this is me and how I'm finding it tough.

This certain doctor told me I need to change my career path and gave me a rediculous amount of drugs. I unboxed the pills from this bag and they gave me 700 codine/paracetamol pills.

473,Back Pain Sufferers what worked for you do to end your pain?!?,"About myself:

How did it all start:
I've had back pain ever since I started working a desk job probably even before that, I think my pain originated from heavy lifting from a college job +  poor postures from my desk job + volleyball which required a lot of jumping. 

What I tried to end my pain:
First I tried a chiropractor, went to many sessions and stick with it for a while but did not see any lasting relief. (chiropractor said my left hip is lower than right and is causing imbalance)

Went to a back doctor, took MRI and some nerve tests (have a bulging disk on L5 and nothing bad came back from nerve test)

Then I Tried PT which they just prescribe you exercises then which you do it ( I thought I could just do these at home and not pay $100 a session for it so I only went to a few sessions) 

Also tried acupuncture without seeing much lasting relief. (The acupuncturist is actually a pretty legit doctor from China and he is also a professor that teaches in universities) 

At home I have bunch of massage equipment, read lots of books about back pain and tried a lot of stretches and exercises and non of them seem to stick and provide lasting relief. 

If you are in the same boat as I am I'm sure that you've tried everything by now and is desperate to find a solution.

My question for people who was able to end their pain, how did you do it?!!

more specifically:
How did you figure out what day to day routine is causing you more pain and what did you do to correct them?

How did you find the exercise that was right for you and stick to doing them consistently? When did you start seeing relief and keep yourself encouraged to keep going. 

Thank you so much!

474,Awful hip pain and leaving for Air Force BMT in 5 days.,"Hello everyone. First and foremost I'm not a native English speaker and I'm trying to translate the name of my diagnosis to the English language so if you don't understand the name of something of what I've said please ask so I try to clear it out.


Ever since I was 15, I have had some sort of ""back pain"" in my left hip region but I could really never tell what it was. Through the years (I turned 20 two months ago) that pain has been increasing and now it's gotten to the point where it is barely bearable. When I'm running I won't notice it much but if I'm standing still or walking it can sometimes become excruciatingly painful (not as much when sitting down), and I'm pretty pretty tolerant to pain. I have never take any meds to make the pain subside.

I did an X-Ray and the results were this (trying my best to translate it):

- Transverse Left Macro-Apophysis of C7
- Left Hemisacralization of L5 with quite noticeable compromise of Intersomatic space in L5/S1
All of the rest seems ok.

During the summer it seemed as though it had gotten a little bit better and I decided to join the Air Force, as I am in a pretty decent physical shape, which I worked hard for, I used to be really fat.
Well, about a week and a half before beginning basic training, which begins in 5 days and lasts 5 weeks, it seems as though all the pain in my back came back and now doubled (Weather just started to become cold, I don't know if it could be from that) and I really struggle sometimes to even walk normally. Things such as standing in attention and maybe marching I know are going to cause me quite a deal of pain.

Now I know I can't fix this but I wonder if anyone out there knows anything that can maybe help me make the pain go away. At least for these following 5 weeks. It's already hell for the normal healthy guy, imagine for me...
So yes, the question is if anyone else is familiar with my condition because I can't find anything about it on google, and if you know of any meds or creams I can put in the region to make the pain go away, just for these 5 weeks... Then I'll go to the doctor about it... I have already signed up and if I quit now they will never let me join again. This is life changing for me...

Thank you everyone for taking the time to read this text. I hope some of you can help me and I wish you all the best. Stay cool.",

477,"Help- Discectomy 1 month ago, debilitating pain now","Hello all. I just found this sub in a desperate attempt to find people who have experienced what I am going through.

The basics: 31yo woman, had insane sciatic pain, couldn't stand up straight, barely walking very suddenly April 2017. Went through bullshit with primary doc- skellaxin, steroids, PT. Finally referred to ortho who ordered MRI. L5-S1 herniation. Referred to pain management center for spinal steroid injections. Did a series of 3, finally mostly pain free as of 7/30/17. During this time the only effective medication was a combo oxycodone and flexeril, but no longer needed these after 3rd injection.

First week September 2017 I fall down the stairs and torque the shit out of my back. Urgent care says it's muscular, rx Valium for spasms. Does not work. Pain mgmt won't rx anything or order imaging, won't see me for a month. Back to primary, where nurse practitioner suggests Tylenol and yoga. Right. Demand referral to neurosurgeon since pain mgmt doc had said if injections did not or stopped working, that was the next step.

Neuro says I need surgery. Surgery was 10/4. Laminectomy was more complicated than expected. Disc had wedged all around the nerve and I was told it took some bone shaving and crazy shit to get all the disc material out. One night in hospital and sent home with oxycodone and flexeril again.

10/7 I am in the ER because I was in screaming agony- SCREAMING. AGONY. Felt like my back was being stabbed over and over. Neuro's office couldn't see me and told me go to the ER. ER forces me to sit upright in a wheelchair for 3 hours. Then a nurse runs that wheelchair literally into a wall. I am at this point an incoherent mess- and I do not get like that. Even when the original pain happened and I ended up on the floor unable to move, I did not cry. This was next level. Spend hours in ER, injections of Valium and morphine. Sent home. 

10/9 middle of the night back pain ratchets up again, now I can barely breathe it's so bad. Back to the ER. Call neuro on duty and expedite getting taken in. Hours of bullshit. Valium again, morphine again, nothing even touches the pain. Sent for an MRI where two nurses literally drop me onto a table right on the incision and then leave me in the MRI having body clenching muscle spasms, ignoring repeated hits of the panic button. Awesome!

End up admitted to the hospital for 3 days, on constant rotation of dilaudid, oxycodone, soma. Eventually I can stand on my own again and they send me home. Follow up a week later with neuro who says I need to be on top of pain meds and muscle relaxer, rest, walk a bit, sit up, try to slowly up activity.

So now it is about 21 days since that follow up. I have called that office many times saying it's just not getting better, really. They say it sounds to them like I'm moving around and that's great so don't worry. In the past week I have gone right back down hill. I can not lie down without a 90% chance that I will be stuck there for several hours. I wake up in pain. 

Tonight I woke up about 45 minutes after falling asleep, screaming. The pain was intense to the point I couldn't see straight. Slammed a oxycodone and a soma and waited it out, slowly inching my way to sitting up, standing, staggering a few steps.

It does not matter how I lie down- side, side with pillows in a million configurations, back, back with lumbar support pillow, back with absolutely nothing, back with 9 pillows arranged under me so I'm basically sitting up. I will relax in my sleep and set off muscle spasms that wake me up in a panic. 

I am beside myself at this point. Obviously I plan to call the surgeon Monday and scream at them til I get an appointment. I'm already shopping for a second opinion.

I'm just here to ask if anyone here has had a similar experience after this surgery. When the surgery was being scheduled I was told I should expect to be ""quite sore"" for a couple weeks, but that I shouldn't require my husband to take off work for more than 3 weeks in order to help care for me and our two small kids (I am a stay at home parent with a work from home job, so I pretty much need him there because I can't even get up to go to the kids let alone lift them). So now here I am and he has been off one extra week already and his job is making it really hard to get approved for family leave. My doc wouldn't see me after follow up #1 so they have clinical notes from a visit where I was doing fine and expected to improve.

I have not once in this entire hellish experience felt ""quite sore."" Every day is majorly painful. Even if I'm not stuck lying in bed screaming with spasms, walking feels like I'm being ripped in half. My hips and back are in constant pain and stiffness. No S1 nerve pain like pre-surgery. This is entirely new pain. I'm utterly blindsided by all of this. The surgeon and his staff insisted the surgery was fairly minor and even after it turned out to be more complicated, he insisted I should expect gradual but consistent improvement. 

So. That's all of it I suppose. If any of you has any insight or similar story to share, I am really really interested to hear it. Thank you all in advance. ",
478,"What is with ""opioid crisis""","Hello all,

This is my first post and its something that i keep seeing that has really started to get on my nerves, but first some backstory.

I am 26 years old male, who lives in Canada. Last November i was working as a custom glass installer in a highrise complex. Anyways one morning i woke up with some minor back pain, something that im used to as i am very tall but most of my height is in my torso quite often i pull my back. I didn't think anything of it went to work. I loaded our truck and at the job site unloaded. As i started working i dropped a tool and went to grab it but i got a shot of pain that knocked the wind out of me and made me fall to the ground. It was the most intense pain I ever had. I went to a clinic and they told me i had sciatica and gave me nsaids. For 3 weeks i couldnt sleep as i was in so much pain. In those 3 weeks i went to the hospital 4 times and each time they just gave me another NSAID's until i started bleeding rectally and was rushed to hospital to find out i had 32 ulcers in my stomach,spleen, and everywhere else you can think. I was allergic to NSAID's which was not fun, was in the hospital for a week and they never decided to check my back.I went home and 12 hours later my fiance brought me back and had a ct scan, than mri to find out 2 of my vertebraes collapsed and i had a birth defect inwhich one of my discs (l5) had a bone growth that had peirced my spinal cord( 1 in 2 000 000 chance i was going to walk again and i was walking and still am :D).I was rushed to sunnybrooke for an emergency surgury on my back.

Now to why im here. I am now in severe chronic pain and must take oxyneo, percs, hydromorphone etc. To function in my daily life.

But i find i am sterotyped for my age and what meds im on to the point i am called a drug addict or that i don't need them to function.

On top of it drs are nervous to perscribe and yea the news makes it that theae drugs are evil and that they are not needed.The problem is that most people that are on these meds are because of situations like mine and studies have proven that most are not addicted nor will be.The other issue is that the crisises is actually more because back in time drs would gice these meds to anyone and everyone who had some pain when really it shouldve been for people who have had surgery or chronic pain and when the government saw the cause instead of tightening down on who should get it and for what kind of pain, they just stop prescribing and than lowering the limit to the point that most of us now live in major pain.

Don't get me wrong these are really serious drugs and there should be tighter laws around who gets them but they should help with people who are tolerant as they need higher doses and should be carefully watched instead of making it like we are criminals and that we should be banned from it.

All that does is make people look to illegal drugs like heroin for there pain relief or people turn to suicide as the thought of living in constant pain is no way of living.",

481,5 years of back pain!!,"Hi everyone, I’m 26 and I’ve been having back pain for a long time now and any advice would be appreciated. 

I’ll try to keep this short, it stated about 5 years ago at work where I was holding onto something on a tail lift of a truck but as the button on the inside was broken I had to lean over and push the button on the side which caused pain to my lower right back. (Imagine standing up straight with your right arm holding something in front of you  and having to lean over to your left while still holding on with you right hand) 

Since then the pain has moved all around my back even up to my neck. I’ve had an MRI which hasn’t shown any problem with my spine so I think the pain is purely muscular. 

I have tried everything to fix it and nothing has worked even though everyone I see has said they can’t see why it’s causing me so much pain. I’ve tried osteopath, chiropractors, physiotherapist, gone to the hospital, gone private, had pins put in my back, sports massage, Thai massage and they guys at work, telling me it was the best massage they’ve ever had, even sent me to a brothel. Imagine telling an Eastern European prostitute, who couldn’t speak much English, about your back pain and only realising what was going on when she took her top off!!

I’ve started swimming which has been helping but when I miss a couple days because of the hours I work the pain comes back so I am looking for a more permanent fix.

491,Right side thoracic/shoulder/neck pain,"Hey guys I'm really tired of whats going on the last few month and hope that maybe someone here can give me some tips on how to handle my situation.

I once arched my back a little too much while benching and kinda felt how the tissue contracted really hard.
The days after that I always woke up with a really stiff neck and back. The neck pain is mostly gone but  if I turn my head all the way to the right I feel pain going around/under my should blade same for pressing my chin back.
Pushing my shoulderblade down or forwards also causes pain.
In addition to that also my lat hurts sometimes.

While exercising I dont experience any pain but after heavy workouts my right side feels super stiff for a while.
I got an MRI coming next week but I dont have any hope in doctors anymore... Thanks in advance ( english is not my mouther tongue btw :))

edit: also I sometimes wake up with my right hand tingling very hard, I saw a chiropracter and an osteopath twice and it didnt help at all.

493,"lower back, aches, pain, stiffness","Hey, 

I had chronic lower back pain/stiffness in my 20s for a couple of years and it seemed to go dorment or away completely with daily stretching. 

Now at 31 ...i have had lower back issues but now they are on a different side and do feel different. Its been off and on for the last 2 years of so. I have been stretching and it helps a lot. And i have had some long stretches without much pain or any , but i am currently really having to fend it off it seems like. 

I've told doctors about it, and back in my mid twenties did see a spine guy for a general checkup...he didn't seem to think it was too serious at my younger age to be cancer or something. 

But now it takes the form of stiffness and tightness, dull aches and pains. And it I sort of rotate my hips around and try to ""feel"" around I can get a pain in my lower pelvis tailbone area. Leftside. 

It felt like siatic pain a few weeks ago...and doing some lifting sort of knocked me out of commission for a couple weeks.

Stretching really helps, and i thought and want to still believe it is the cure , or the maintenance plan for me. If a doctor assured me it was the best thing i could do and my pain would be there but be manageable my whole live i'd be happy to live with what i got. I just don't want to be not addressing something that could be getting worse, or something that will require surgery down the line. 

I guess my concerns aren't so much the pain, although its there, but manageble...i just dont want something to be serious like cancer or something else that i could be being more proactive about. 

That said, I dont have insurance , which definitely needs to change. Working on that. But does anyone have any advice or experience out there.

I guess my back is like walking on a tight rope sometimes. Like i can maintain and do well....but anything seems to be able to throw it off. Like its generally tight a lot and any minor thing might throw it off. It sometimes feel like i have to be perfect with my stretching routine, posture, etc or something will catch it. 

Sometimes i wonder if it is anxiety related too...of psychological. I definitely have delt with those issues at times, and i know the body can manifest those things. Idk. 

In terms of my lifestyle too, I am sober since i was 23, eat healthy. 

One things maybe sort of connected could be GI issues, I had some pretty bad digestion and constipation until i went gluten free 7 years ago. But I do get some occasional IBS type symptoms , at times, so i wonder if it could be related...something like inflammation or i dont know. 

Thanks",

496,Severe back pain followed by no pain for one year. How to address it with Doc?,"Hello, I first injured my back about 18 months ago. I believe it was a mix of working a very sedentary job at a desk for about 12-14 hours per day and then going to do very strenuous weight lifting and running. The PT said it's horrible to spend that long loading the spine throughout the day and then go and punish it in the gym with compound lifts. In her words ""It's asking for trouble"". Pretty much I was in a lot of pain at first, it subsided after about 30-45 days and became more manageable. I have since put a lot more effort into strengthening my lower back, glutes, hips, and the rest of the core so that I'm better supported. This has helped. 

The real issue is that occasionally I will stand up from sitting and it will feel like someone just hit my back with a sledge hammer. It hurts to stand, it hurts to take a step, pain radiates from just under the small of my back into my left glute/hamstring area, and my pain goes to a 9/10 as I sweat and my heart rate skyrockets. 

This has happened three times in the past few months and didn't happen before that. The crazy thing is it normally lasts a few minutes until I feel a pop/shift in my back and I go from all of that to completely normal and pain free, with some mild stiffness in my back. Just that shift returns everything to normal and I haven't figured out how to replicate it to solve the issue faster, it just happens as I shuffle in pain. 

Occasionally when I stand up I will feel a very similar shift in the spine though it isn't painful. The bad part is normally when I go to my PT, I am feeling fine and I can't exactly make it hurt or let her hear the shift. I would like an MRI so I can see what the issue is and if there's anything accompanying it. She has been very resistant to this because I come in at a 1/10 or 2/10 pain level normally and my Doctor said he didn't want to because sometimes people will imagine pain that doesn't exist if the MRI comes back saying something bad. 

I personally find it puzzling as in the past 10 years I have torn my MCL, labrum, plantar fascia in both feet, concussions, injured my thumb, and every one of those my past doctors were more than willing to scan it so we could see what the problem was and if surgery or other treatments would assist. I feel like my spine health is much more important to me than any of those and am baffled that I am uninformed about the problem past ""it hurts"" and ""It becomes unbearable at times"". I know that surgery isn't the best and I really am against it at this point, but I would like to know what is going on. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for how I should speak to my PT/Doc about this? I don't think the MRI is going to fix my problem, but I think knowledge is power and it would help me make informed decisions now and later. I have been doing PT for a year now and the general day to day pain has mainly subsided to be replaced by crippling but short term pain. Thanks!",
497,Degenerative damage in C6-C7 w/ Osteophytes,"Hi Back Pain. 

New here. I've been working with the doctor over the last while to determine the cause of headaches and back pain.

Short backstory: Played hockey my whole life, and have had several head / neck injuries from such. 2.5 years ago after a severe enough concussion, the back/neck/Head pain haven't subsided even after my head was cleared as OK.

Following up and I've recently had the diagnosis:

""Degenerative Changes at the lower cervical spine with osteophytes and disc space narrowing primary at C6-C7""

I know I need to first, get myself healthy again and back into shape. I've gained a lot of weight since being injured and unable to work out. 

In addition, I'm mostly sedentary in the chair. And I think this is leading to the bulk of the discomfort and pain I'm still experiencing. I sit with a slouch that my doctor says is only making it worse.

What I'm looking for;

* possible exercises I can do that won't exacerbate the problem that is not impact-full on the spine/neck.

* new furniture, namely chair that helps encourage good posture and enough back support to keep my neck straight. every chair I currently have has terrible back support and i always end up slouching. 



Thanks for any guidance and assistance.

500,I’m on Methylprednisolone for sinus problems but it’s helping my back!?!,"I’m a 22 year old female. I had a sinus infection two weeks ago, was given amoxicillin for 10 days. Symptoms came back when I stopped it. I made an appt with my PCP and she looked in my nose and said you’re extremely swollen but not infection. She looked in my ears and determined they’re full of fluid and it’s causing my vertigo. She said my head isn’t exactly pressurizing. 

She threw me on Methylprednisolone 4mg for 6 days, take OTC allergy meds, and a nasal steroid. I took all 6 doses tonight together and I’m like wow holy shit I’m feeling 70% better already. 

I was diagnosed with a L5 stress fracture in mid July - saw ortho for it and said I’ll be as good as new with rest for 12 weeks and light PT after 4 weeks. I went to PT a couple times and stopped going once they told me all they’d do is back massages, they wouldn’t touch my joint. Sorry I’m not paying $60 copay per visit 2-3x weekly. Needless to say, my back has never been the same. I still have a fracture ache and my hip sometimes flat out doesn’t want to work from time to time. But hurts to some extent everyday. I’ve come to terms there probably isn’t anything else that can be done and I’m going to have to just get used to it. 

After taking my Methylprednisolone, the pain has lessened and I’m able to bend almost normal. I googled and it says it’s sometimes prescribed for fractures and nerve pain. 

Can someone elaborate on Methylprednisolone for the uses of fractures/nerves?

So I've been pushing through pain for two years. Some days it's bad, some days it's not so bad. Saturday night I was assembling a dresser with my wife, and I was sitting on the floor. I twisted to the right to pick up a tool and in that instant, it felt like a bomb exploded in my lower back. I couldn't get up, I had to lay on my back on the floor it was so painful. I couldn't sit straight up. Eventually I had to roll to my side and push myself up. I can't bend over now without excruciating pain, every time I take a step and put weight on my legs it sends pain through my back. Driving to work was hard, pressing the pedals hurts, hitting bumps hurts, sitting at my desk hurts, using my standing desk hurts, walking hurts....

It's very dull and is only in the lower back (no shooting pain or pain in my legs). It's in the center of my lower back right in my tail bone area. It flares up a bit after I sit down for a long time. My lower back is very tight and I cannot touch my toes. No matter how hard I try to hinge at the hip to touch my toes, I can't. I can only hinge at my mid back as my hamstrings get super tight. The thing that makes the pain flare up the worst is hyperextensions. The lower back pain isn't severe but it's preventing me from working out out of fear of making things worse.

506,Leg length surgery?,"So after getting laying scanogram done I found out that right  femur is 1.2 cm longer and right tibia is .4 cm shorter which means .8 cm descrapancy or 8 mm. 

A specialist told me I should just put a 8mm lift in my left leg. Now I've done countless x rays and found that my hips are even, spine straight (no scoliosis) at about 25mm. So the rest of the descrpancy is in my hips/pelvis or the 8mm number is not fixed and changes when standing or at different times due to muscle tightness etc. 

My question since I have a descrpancy and since I've seen many docs therapists specialists, is leg length surgery the only true solution to this? But is that even worth it? I have Low back pain and want a perfectly symmetric body so I can gain muscle. Is there another solution than leg length surgery? Physical therapist, chiros etc never worked other stuff is all temporary


Unless there's a way to find out my actually discrepancy the fixed number to put under my left leg such as 8 mm or something In between that to 25mm, would a lift under my left leg do the exact same thing that the leg length surgery would do if the number was right. If that is the case, people that have the same problem as me, why would they ever get surgery? Would evening the legs through surgery or shoe lift is the same thing or is one better than the other? 

Also is there a surgery that fixes the discrepancy in the pelvis/hips or is it the same surgery as leg length? Or once you fix leg length does that automatically fix the discrepancy in pelvis maybe?",

Doc says that since there is SOME relief, it could not have been that the procedure went wrong. He says it's probably that the steroid is actually causing inflammation in my nerves. To that end, he's prescribed some pretty powerful anti-inflammatories and told me to take three times a day like clockwork for the next ten days, in addition to the painkillers I've been on.

Just wondering what your experience is with Spinal Decompression Therapy. 

My wife is about 30 years old, and she had an x-ray done after having numbness in her legs and terrible back pain. The x-ray showed a severely herniated disc that had leaked most of its fluid out. The chiropractor only does spinal decompression therapy, and he said that was the way to go because as a 30 year old, if she had back surgery, she would need more surgeries due to the way her back will compensate for the metal plates.

534,"First step to fixing sacroiliac/venusdimple ""tightness""?","background: I'm about to start reading McGill's book. I have a long history 7 year of chronic back pain without known structural cause. Recent observations by an osteopath align with how I feel: high right hip and low right shoulder, causing sacroiliac/venusdimple pain on the right, and central pain in the mid-to upper back. it's been speculated that I have weak stabilizers which causes me to experience pain and fatigue holding static postures, like sitting or standing. I also don't evenly weight my feet.

tl-dr; I want to solve this one step at a time, since I've been receiving too much general-based care and exercises. 


One way to consistently observe something that is wrong with me is for me to be in a [cobra pose](https://previews.123rf.com/images/dimol/dimol1507/dimol150700111/42871285-Beautiful-sporty-fit-yogini-woman-practices-yoga-asana-bhujangasana-cobra-pose-beginner-variation-in-Stock-Photo.jpg)

Then, I bend my right knee like this o--_| and swing it side to side, which makes my lower back on the right side feel very tight (especially when swinging my leg toward the inside of my body). Stressing the muscle like this feels good and bad at the same time. When swinging my left leg, there's no tightness on the left side, and no significant stress felt anywhere.

I am constantly receiving advice from various professionals to do things like hip hinges, squats and glute bridges but I don't understand how these can be effective if one side is messed up and the other is not. I'm really not targeting the source of the problem.

weightless helps

if its not too late stretching helps

pain killers help but not for nerve pain

which it sounds like, is very common

cannabis helps if its not too late

cannabis helps find what limitations are from pain,

and what is ur back

right now cannabis doesn't help me cause the pain is numbed a bit

but nerve pain shoots through no matter what

could just be that my issue is super bad tho

id say its worth trying i got more relief from pain and it did help me sleep

haven't tried edibles (talk about this a lot cause its real pain killers)

on that topic CBD oil doesn't work, could be the 50 dollar one i bought tho

i hear narcotics work temporarily but are addictive like crazy

surgery is hit or miss from what i heard too

obviously im no doctor

any tips at all. 

feels like the sad truth is that if it gets too bad ur kinda boned

ps if u do take care and the pain stops its always ready to return, never stop or else. thats like a warning i wish i knew

538,"Lower back pain, now radiating down to ankle/calf","I'll try to detail the past 6 months or so, in hopes of hearing suggestions from others who have had similar experiences. It all began with lower back pain, which was able to be relieved via chiropractic visits, and massages. The pain came and went, but I just needed to be careful with what I did. roughly 5 weeks ago, I woke up in an overwhelming amount of pain. The pain started in my lower back, and went down my left leg. Walking wasn't an option, and I would have to drag myself places in the house to avoid adding to the pain. After a week or so of this, the pain moved down my left leg, and eventually into my ankle. It feels like I have a broken ankle, but I know that is not the case. I am unable to sit up straight without causing more pain. Bent over relieves the pain immensely. From time to time the pain will relocate into my calf, and feel like a bad charlie horse. I have gone to a local bone and joint clinic, and the nurse gave me an xray. They didn't see any issues on the xray, so they suggested physical therapy, and scheduled an appointment with one of their back specialist doctors (a month away). So far, PT hasn't helped with the issue. They have me laying on my left side, and trying to twist my spine around by touching my right shoulder to the table, and bringing my right leg over and around. Anyone else experience something similar, and if so, what was your end result which helped relieve the nerve pain? ",
539,Received bad news and need to vent,"I've had neck pain with radiating pain to my shoulder and left arm for at least 10 years. It's not constant. I used to have months or even a year without issues. The last two years though I've been sidelined monthly with severe pain that has led me to be irritable at minimum and bedridden at the worst.

Every time this has flared up in the past decade I would see a doctor and they would hypothesize about my posture or that I may have strained something without knowing. I used to joke that my head was just too heavy for my neck, or that I just had ""shitty-neck"". I've done PT, chiropractor, pain meds, muscle relaxers... I assume due to my age (I'm 32 now) no one thought to do any imaging. To my knowledge I've never even injured my neck.

Finally my GP that I've been seeing for a while recommended I get some imaging done since I'd run the gamut of more straightforward options. After an x-ray showed degenerative changes to my c2-c6 vertebrae (osteoarthritis) and cartilage he recommended an MRI. This has come back showing narrowing of my spinal canal that's causing flattening of the spinal cord that is consistent with my pain. Now he's recommending I see a neurosurgeon to go over my options (he's hopeful surgery won't be needed, but it seems every step this just gets more scary).

So now I'm sitting around waiting for my referral to come through and thinking about all the things in my life I enjoy doing and whether I'll be able to keep doing them. I'm thinking of all the things I've ever done and wondering if they have put me into this situation. My doctor was baffled when I said I have never had a neck injury. My only major accident was a skiing accident when I was 12. I broke my femur and was in a wheelchair, but there was no indication at that time that I'd sustained any other trauma.

My PT and phsysiatrist have both recommended a sit/stand desk to help with both the pain and the healing. I'm not really sure what my regimen should look like, such as ""half hour up, half hour down"" or longer periods standing, etc. 

This first week, I've found other back muscles becoming fatigued while standing for long durations, as well as my leg and feet feeling achy and tired. This is not surprising but I was wondering if you all had any advice for how to get the most benefit and feel the best with this. Thanks!",

The only thing he can recommend is to try therapy, but he was honest to say that the only thing they really do is show you a few exercises, which I am already doing. 

While a part of me is relieved, I can't help but be even more worried that I do not know the problem of my lower back pain (sharp pain in spine when bending forward, no leg pain. I injured doing deadlifts and then a couple of months doing squats). This has been going for about a year, and about 4-5 months since I started doing something about it.

Once in a while, I have some mild muscle pain. Nothing shooting or radiating, it's not nerve pain, it's muscle and its in my lumbar region. Doesn't stop me from living life but it's annoying. I *hate* opiates and refuse to take them so I manage the occasional back twinge with NSAID, not everyday. Bengay works well but I don't want to smell like it if I can help it. I am interested in getting a TENS device.

Any good brands you guys can recommend? I see so many out there, I'm kind of overwhelmed.

548,Lower back pain and sciatica relieved during sleep,"Hi,  
I am 29 years old and I've been suffering from mild-medium lower back pain for the last 7 months, with sciatica in left leg for about 4 months, and right leg for 3 months (pain in the legs is mostly around back of the hips, buttocks and soles of the feet).  
Never had any serious medical issues before.    
I first noticed the pain when sitting for long periods (I work in IT so sitting a lot, although I recently got a standing desk).  
I also feel pain when standing for long periods.  
Sometimes the pain just comes and goes throughout the day regardless of sitting/standing - and it can change every day (some days can be with almost no pain, others can be without relief from pain)

I've done CT, MRI.  
Imaging shows some mild disc bulges at l5-s1, l4-l5, but according to several doctors - nothing too dramatic, and not pinching any nerve roots.   
I asked my doctor about sitting/standing MRI, and he says that it might produce new findings, but unfortunately this option is not available in my country, and would probably be pointless since it would not change the doctor's recommendation of physical therapy, swimming, yoga etc.  
I've tried some conservative treatments over this period - physio didn't help much, Now i'm doing Iyengar Yoga for about a month (supervised) which seems to help a little, and I hope for further progress.   
The thing is, I still have bad days, with pain all throughout the day, and these days truly make me feel hopeless.

Something interesting I've noticed in particular, which I couldn't find any evidence for online - the pain is usually relieved when sleeping at night, and often when I wake up in the morning there in no pain at all for a while.  
This is the opposite of many cases I see online, where pain is worse at night and in the morning.  
I also feel a trend of worsening pain throughout the day, being at it's worst during the evening when I get off work.  

This sits well with the fact that I'm stationary most day at work either sitting or standing (despite alternating positions, and doing some light exercise).  

These observations lead me to believe that the root cause of my pain might be some muscle imbalances such as weak or short muscles.  
Does it make sense that some muscles are relaxed during the night and tense up during the day causing these pains somehow? 
Are there any muscle groups I should focus my exercise on?  
I always suspected I might have APT / hyperlordosis (are they the same thing?) but doctors don't  see it in MRI.  
For example, when taking a wall test as illustrated here - http://lelldc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/against-the-wall.jpg , I can achieve the correct position easily (butt, shoulders and head touching wall), but I feel that my lower back is over-arched, and too far away from the wall.  
Does anyone have similar experiences?  recommendations?

551,Lower back pain...guys help?,"Hi Guys,

Around 6 months ago, during deadlifting, I felt a little strain on my lower back. I knew my form wasn't right so I went back home. Next day my back was a little sour but thought it will recover soon thinking its just a muscle pull or something. Around a week later, I started having intense lower back pain only if I when i stand from sitting position. It became so bad that I oculdn't sit for more than 5 minutes. I went to the doctor and it took two months for MRI. My MRI result shows L4-5 disc protrusion. However the doctor said MRI report really doesnt say anything so he suggested me some exercises/waking etc.

Funny thing is that I never felt any pain when chiro/physio tried to press my lower back and had negative tests when they tested me for sciatica pain.

Now, after 6 months, I was able to sit for longer but now I can feel very minor pain when I try and bend backwards and if someone presses L4-L5. I also feel a little tingling pain on top of my right butt when I sit and I can feel that the lower back pain is there. The pain isn't too severe(3 on a scale of 1-10) but it is exceptionally frustrating as I feel it all the time when I sit/bend/drive etc. I have tried everything (chirp/physio/doc) but since whenever they do all the typical tests, I dont feel much pain they conclude that minor exercises will make it better in few months.

I feel really depressed now, I don't know if it will get better?Do injections help?Does it really take that long for lower back to be ok?its been 6 months and I feel very very demotivated. Someone guide me? Thanks!",

554,I'm writing a back pain relief book,"Hey everyone,
I'm in the process of writing a back pain relief book. It won't be finished until maybe towards the end of the year, but I'd like to share some of the content in it and my reason for writing it.

I have been having back pain for many years now (I go into detail in the book as to why). Anyway, one day it was so bad that when I got out of bed, I had shooting pain in my back with every step that I took. It was almost like I was supposed to just lay in bed but there was no way I wanted to be stuck in bed all day.

So I started doing research and experimenting. After some time, I stumbled upon using an exercise ball for back pain exercises. The leverage and cushion of the ball really helped me in ways it hadn't before.

So here's the structure of the book:
1. My reason for writing it.
2. How the ball can help you.
3. The size of the ball that you should use based on your height.
4. Getting started with the exercises.
5. Picking the right exercises and intensity for you.
6. Hyperextension and reverse hyperextension exercises
7. Spinal extension exercise (not as intense as it may sound)
8. Frog like exercise for the hip flexor as these can be affected by back pain and pull on the hip flexors.
9. Regular everyday tips for relief and health.
If you're interested in this please let me know and I'd be happy to send it to you when it comes out or during the process of writing and you can test it yourself.

Or if you have suggestions or something you're facing, let me know and I can work on incorporating that.

Thanks for reading!",
555,Is surgery a viable option?,"Hi everyone,

About 6 months ago I went to the doctor to for back pain that I was having, only to get xrays and find out that I had a compression fracture on my L5, and it had slid forward about 1 cm, or .4 Inches.

After taking 3 months of recovery, I started going to physio and the pain got better. But this past 2 weeks I have been in constant pain every single day, with tingling in my legs and my right foot going numb. Went back to the doctor, he prescribed aleve (naproxen) and said if I lose control of my bowels then to go to the emergency room immediately. I asked about surgery and he told me that it should be a last resort, and I'm not guaranteed to get better from it.

The Aleve hasn't made a difference for me, and I feel I'm running out of options. I find the pain to be super limiting, and only being 21 I don't want to live the rest of my life like this. So I'm wondering if I should start looking into surgery, or if anyone has any other recommendations. Thanks",
556,"I have been suffering from an easily ""tweaked"" lower back for years since a deadlift injury. Could this simply be a QL muscle issue?","Edit: The more I do [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXh1oLXb6zk) stretches and consider my lifestyle history (sleeping on my left side, sitting to one side when PC gaming to adjust for my mouse [right] hand, using a lopsided desk chair for years, keeping my wallet in my right pocket, driving with my left arm elevated at the steering wheel and my right hand reaching down for the stick, etc) the more convinced I am that all of my debilitating back issues stem from a tight QL. It seems like the QL muscle isn't well-understood nor recognized (only TWO POSTS in the history of this subreddit have ever made mention of it), but it seems like a highly important lower back muscle that is prone to dysfunction, particularly in my case (S1-L3 region pain; MRI only shows slight bulges to those discs).  
  
I first tweaked my lower back 3 years ago at the age of 21 when I had returned to the gym after a long hiatus and tried to deadlift 315 without a warmup. But it didn't end there. Every few weeks after that, when my back gets a bit tight, I get the same sudden sharp pain I had when I first hurt my back, and it usually happens when I do mundane things like leaning over to pet the dog and feeding the fish. It always feels as if someone has just jabbed a screwdriver into the L5 portion of my spinal cord. The resulting soreness after a tweak can be debilitating to the extent that it's sometimes hard to move my legs for a day or two, although sometimes my lower back is just really sore and stiff. It doesn't happen, however, when I'm doing deadlifts and squats; deadlifts just seem to make my back more tight and sore, and squats usually don't even give me issues.    
  
When I do targeted right-sided QL stretches (specifically the ones from ATHLEAN-X on YouTube), it seems to miraculously get rid of my back pain throughout my WHOLE back and get me moving normally again. My working theory is that I strained the lower portion of the right QL years ago I and repeatedly strain it again and again when it's overcompensating for other muscles. The pain makes sense somewhat in this context: the QL attaches to the sacrum, lumbar spine, and 12th rib, and when it's tight it feels like it's pulling down on that rib, causing the upper right-side back issues I also have and compressing the discs and other tissues.  
  
Can anyone with experience with the QL muscle comment on this? I want to believe it's a QL issue since it's the best theory I've come up with, but I've been wrong so many times about what is causing my disability and I don't want to get over-confident. I've also never heard of someone describing an identical pain to what I'm describing, but I also think I predisposed myself to a QL injury because before the injury, I was sedentary for a few months and had a slightly bruised coccyx, which caused my right glute to become weak, forcing the QL to overcompensate. I am really hoping someone here knows something about the QL or has any other ideas, because I need help. I look like the guy who could carry your fridge up the stairs (my diet is damn near perfect too), but I feel like a cripple because I always fear throwing out my back when I lean over.

561,How can I prevent throwing my back out a 3rd time?,"I am 24 and maintain a pretty healthy weight (140 lbs at 5'8"") yet I've thrown out my back twice within 6 months of each other. The first time was far worse, I couldn't move an inch without pain and had to crawl to get around. After rest and several chiropractor sessions, I finally healed. I began changing my posture, the way I bend, and exercising more (mostly in the form of running, which I wasn't doing before). 
That's why I was shocked when I managed to throw it out again the second time just two days ago. This time is less severe, I am able to walk to get around at least and have already had one chiropractor session which has helped, but I need some advice on how I can improve my lifestyle and avoid this from happening again, at least for a long while. 

To add, both times I've thrown it I wasn't even doing heavy lifting. I was putting on a pair of pants/shorts while standing. Pathetic, I know. I've shown my chiropractor how I do this movement and he suggested I now sit on the bed for this action. 
Anyway, what else should I be doing differently? When exercising, what should I be focusing on to strengthen my back? I've read on here some people mentioning core workouts, is that the key?

563,How do I get back to my normal activities?,"I'm a 22 year old female. I'm recovering from a stress fracture on the lateral aspect of L5. I've finally hit the 12 week mark. WOOHOO! My doctor said I'm free to do whatever my body allows me at this point since the bone is stable. 

However I'm noticing the small things I've done over the weekend kind of have my back screaming. I'm a server in a sports bar ( I was on light duty for the last 12 weeks) and tonight I picked up my first serving shift which lasted only 3 hours and I'm not feeling all that great. I didn't even pick up anything heavier than a drink tray. 

As I'm laying in bed that fracture ache is back. UGH. I also will get occasional nerve pain. 

How do I get back to normal!? Do I just keep on pushing through? If I do any less than what I'm doing now I'll be right back at where I was for the past 12 weeks.

564,Lower back pain past year,"I've had a good amount of lower back pain for the past year or so. I believe it all started after I sat in a chair at my corporate job for 12 to 14 hours a day during some months. I am 6 ft 3 inches, 190lbs, and 28 years old for reference. One day I was moving some boxes and may have lifted with my back slightly and I felt sharp pain. Unfortunately with healthcare the way it is I'm afraid to head to the doctor as I have a very high deductible and simply can't afford it.  I've since quit that corporate job and now work 9 to 5 (still sitting in a chair) in hopes that things would get better but they haven't. I feel the pain when I'm sitting or bending over in the lower back. I get a lot of relief when my wife massages my lower back or my glutes.

Please help. I am in good shape physically all considering. I've seen a chiropractor once who said he believes I pulled a muscle but that was 5 months ago and I would think they pain would have gone away by now.

Searching in this subreddit I've found McGill's stretches that I will now do religiously. Is there any other advice that doesn't include me spending lots of money?

Thanks and I love you guys

565,My back pain is going to make me want to kill myself,"I've tried everything. The last three years I have had increasingly crippling back pain, although doctors keep telling me I'm fine and normal. Every moment is just a degree of much it hurts, most times becoming crippling. I call off and leave early from work because even laying down hurts. I try to go to the gym but all it does is make it worse. I stretch daily, constantly am aware of my posture and I give myself as light of a load as possible but no matter what I am always in pain. I can't sleep because of it, I can't get out of bed because of it, I can't even drive without wanting to be in tears. I've hoped it would go away but it's only gotten worse, and is at a point that I can't have any life plans because of it. I never feel happy because everything is secondary to the constant pain I'm feeling. I don't know what to do. Pain killers don't seem to work anymore. Even laying down hurts. I'm losing money because I can't work, and I just don't know what to do. My life is completely halted by the constant pain. I don't have anything to live for in this kind of pain. It has completely taken over everything in my life.

Continuing work as usual, half way through a shift something must have changed, suddenly I'm unable to bend over or lift things. Driving home was agony. I've since called in sick due to this and have seen a Dr... Prescribed Naproxen and Zapain which do absolutely nothing for the pain.

I'm writing this in the hopes someone has some advice for me, it's currently too late to see a doctor, but I plan on seeing one again to have a scan of some sort as I think this may be more serious than I initially thought. (And seemingly getting worse...)

572,Woke up to incredible si-joint pain,"Hi.

This happened several months ago, but I decided to post this one since I will soon get blood results for a possible rheumatism so it's a timely topic.


At one morning in May, I woke up mid-sleep. It was early in the morning. First it felt like I had eaten something bad the night before - this slight burning sensation in my groin and stomach. Once I got up from my bed though, oh boy was it a hell ride!

The most intense pain I could know of had settled up in the right si joint of my lower back. It was an excrusiating pain - I couldn't lay down, I couldn't sit, I couldn't stay up, for nothing could lessen the pain that I was feeling. I looked to the mirror and the large back muscles above the si joint where cramping. My face went white from the pain and I had this cold sweat as I took a prescription pain relief (Panacod, which was originally prescribed for my monthly migraines) and headed to the nearest pharmaseutical, which was over half a kilometer away. There had been one just around the corner around a year ago, but it had closed down. Damnit!

I had to sit down to rest at times, as I made my way to the pharmaseutical. I felt myself incredibly old, shouldn't these kind of problems be reserved for the old age? And what the hell was this pain anyway? I arrived to the drug store and sat down to a chair to wait for someone to come and help me. Which to my surprise, no one did. The store was now empty but no pharmaseuts approached me, on the contrary, they had retreated behind the desk to small chat amongst each other.
That's when I understood it - I probably looked like a drug addict in withdrawal. Pale face, sweating and trembling. I went to the desk to ask for help. At this point my voice was constantly breaking, out of sheer pain and I was close to fainting. She gave me some cold gel (those for sport injuries) and anti-inflammatory lotion for the muscle.

I headed to the nearest toilet and applied one of them. As I was heading back home, Panacod had already started to do its thing and I was more and more numbed to the pain. I went to sleep and slept for around 2 to 3 hours. When I woke, I was surprised to find that the pain had gone away.

Still, for the next week my si joint had a habit of aching. The first few days were the worst - I would sit at my computer for around an hour, and it would start to ache. It went to the point where I had to take a break and do some back relieving movements as the pain was starting to become too intense.

The ache dissipated after a week, but even to this day the si joint has a habit of making either a slight burning sensation or tingling from time to time. Sometimes there's a quick pain sensation when I make a wrong move, after a long period of sitting. Still, it goes away instantly.

What do you think of all of this?


TLDR; Intense pain at si joint upon waking up. Was aching for a week or so. After that, only burning sensation and tingling at si joint from time to time.",
573,When is it time to ask if you've had a failed surgery?,"I am 14 months since my spinal fusion at L5-S1. The last several weeks have seen the re-emergence of some very familiar pains and sensations. I know, I know, a single level fusion is quite mild compared to other back surgeries. And I am lucky, I had immediate nerve relief, even if it took extensive rehab for me to leave the hospital. I don't know what kind of history or context is needed here, so I will try and give you guys a summary of my journey thus far. 

January 2015, I am moving a 90in TV at work down some basement stairs. I know how it sounds but the TV in question was quite light, it just took my full wingspan to grasp it. I was an AV installer for a large company for six years. I was on the top going down s tiny flight of outdoor basement stairs. I obviously had to bend a bit being on the top of the lift. With my wingspan completely open, I twisted just the smallest bit to one side, and immediately felt the shift in my body's internal mechanics. I knew something was wrong right away. No loud ""pop"" or anything like that. But when you use your body for a living and do these things thousands of times, you know immediately when something is wrong. I finish my work, report the incident, etc. End up on workers comp. we spent the time from February 2015-September 2015 years exhausting any and all conservative treatment options (aside from alternative treatments comp would never cover.) Multiple injections, months of PT. Plataued in progress around April or may of that year. Brick wall, not getting better, barely managing to keep the progress we found in PT. Two epidural injections (waking up on the table during the second one sucked pretty bad) and the second round almost seemed to agitate the area worse. My MRI in that spring showed a fairly nasty herniation at L5-S1, with a negligible herniation directly above. By August 2015, we finally decided to start meeting with surgeons. I'll skip the workers comp nightmare, but after a lot of shenanigans, I finally found a fantastic neurosurgeon in May... of 2016. Almost a year after deciding on surgery, and close to 18 mos post injury. After very in depth talks with my surgeon, we decided the more aggressive procedure of a single level fusion was best, given success rates of single level fusions, and my young age (I was 27 by this point.) Surgery went well, some minimal anesthesia complications afterwards, but nothing too threatening. Recovery was extremely slow, maybe because I had spent close to two years stuck at home (yay, works comp :/) I continued PT and felt a bit stronger for a while, as the bone continued to fuse and show nicely on periodic x rays. I was discharged via an independent medical examination by a dr of WC's choosing. Basically a quack to discharge me from care ASAP to reduce cost. This, however it my benefits, and cut me from further visits with my ACTUAL neurosurgeon who performed the surgery. I am still experiencing a lot of localized pain at the time my one year check up was supposed to be, but I was informed further visits and testing would not be covered. I never got to voice my concerns with my surgeon properly. 

So, I've given it a few months and continues some weeks of PT before that was of course cut off. I am no where near the strength or mobility I was at before the injury.  However, as I said, the bone has fused very well according to x rays. That said, the x rays do not account for soft material like disks. So I have not had an updated MRI since the spring of 2015. Of late, I've been experiencing occasional (escalating in reoccurrence) radiating nerve pain in a similar area as I was before surgery. Definitely not the same exact position, but very close. This is on top of general weakness of the core due to lack of activity pre op, and post op pain never really reducing enough to allow normal activity to pick up again. I'm fearing the worst at this point. The signs I'm seeing lead me to believe the negligible herniation above the fused level has deteriorated, or began doing so and is no longer negligible. My sleep has always been an issue, before and after surgery, but lately I can't even lay down in my bed without being miserable. Never mind getting a restful nights sleep. You can imagine how that affects every other aspect of life. 


Have any of you had similar experiences? Am I worrying about nothing? I want nothing more than to never even see a pain pill, muscle relaxer or nerve related medication again. I was sure a year into this after surgery I would be nearly back to normal. I am much better to a degree, but seem to be trending back downhill. What are your thoughts and experiences on this! Any advice? Similar stories? I turn 30 about a year from now, and all I've wanted is to be able to return to Brazilian jiu-jitsu by that milestone. I'm seriously doubting that at this point though. 

Thanks, if you made it this far.

I was diagnosed with a C4/5 herniation earlier this year, which is mostly manageable with with meds (gabapentin and, when needed, tramadol).

However, over the last few years I've gone through periods where I've had difficulty sleeping as I'm constantly woken up by what I can only describe as an electric shock sensation beneath one of my shoulder blades that repeats every five minutes or so. This is followed by a few minutes of feeling tense/anxious. If I get up and wander around it doesn't recur, but starts up again once I lay down.

It's never been that much of a problem until the last few nights, when I'm now getting this sensation down the muscles along one side of my spine. I've had very little sleep and it's gone way beyond being the occasional inconvenience it once was.

582,Don't understand why I'm hurting all of a sudden,"So I'm 25 and for some reason have back pain. Now I had back pain when I was younger, around high school. What would usually happen is if i exerted myself near exhaustion then my back would ache and I would just rest up and be better within a day or two.

Still this was suspicious so I went to the doctor and had X-rays done and neither the doc or the expert at the lab saw anything. Still the problem pursed and yet again, a year later I went to the doctor, had X-rays and still nothing.

So fast forward to a couple of months ago, first day of summer I went to play basketball as I normally do, and the following day my back was in awful pain, like I couldn't stand let alone walk. 

I went to the chiro that day. I got a back brace and some heat and I was a little better. The chrio had X-rays done and discovered I had acute scoliosis (fuck the doctor) anyway I did some adjustments and learned some stretches and it's a little bit better. BUT I am nowwhere near what I used to be. What is wrong? It can't just be the minor scoliosis? I can't walk to far without my back hurting?

I haven't been back to the chiro because a couple of adjustments in and he started adjusting my neck and I got serious whiplash and vertigo. Which then led to a host of other issues.

Today, having taken no hydrocodone in a few days and feeling in much less pain (probably in part because of the epidural I'd had the same day as my episode) we're considering going ahead with our trip to the U.K. on Tuesday. With the diminished pain and several days of rest mixed with walks and some of the McGill stretches I feel more confident about having a good time on the trip. Additionally, I've been prescribed gabapentin for the pressure being exerted on my nerve, causing some numbness in my foot and big toe. 

My lingering concerns are surrounding the long flight and having to be seated for a lot of it (I'll get up and walk around every so often) along with the new fear I live with of having an acute episode again. Because it's the first time it has ever happened and it occurred upon waking up, Im nervous it could strike again. Am I correct to believe that with the care I'm now taking and with proper lifting of objects, posture, etc. I should most likely be ok, even in the short term?

If I sleep seated on the flight will I risk waking up with some serious issue again? Should I just try and stay awake and move every half hour instead?

My main problem is my left leg always feel tired and weak. I've had these for several years now. Already went to several doctors with no improvement.

1. Ortho: Did a back xray, said it was ok. Recommended exercise, vitamins. No improvement.

2. Physical Therapist: Did stretches, exercise, and some machine therapy for about 6 sessions, no improvement.

3. Chiropractor: Did what they usually do (fix my neck and stuff). Also did stretches, exercise, and fascial manipulation (torturous therapy) for several sessions, no improvement.

4. Vascular surgeon: Did ultrasound, found out I had venous insufficiency in left leg. Recommended compression stockings + medication (Daflon) + exercise. Some improvement on the leg issues. It appears that I have to do this forever because if I stop the meds and the compression stockings, the leg issues comes back.

Bottom line: my leg pain only stared after a trauma on the area but all the doctors seem to think the leg issue originates from my back. I kinda agree with them because there are times that the leg issue also appears on my right leg but only on very rare occasions. 90% of the time the issues is on my left leg.

The vascular surgeon says I do not need leg surgery but I am still considering getting one because I don't want to take meds and wear stockings forever.

The weird thing is that I never feel it when I'm exercising. At all. When I run, lift, whatever.

594,Woke up in agonizing pain. Frustrated and fatigued.,"After a few episodes of sciatica over the last year, I started physical therapy. After 2 months and not much relief or change in pain and frequency, I was sent to get an MRI and to a physiatrist. The MRI showed 2 herniated discs in the lumbar region of my spine.

The physiatrist told me time (and proper exercise) was the primary cure. He also gave me an epidural injection, which relieved the pain for about a month. The pain came back, though, and so I scheduled another epidural for this past Friday (yesterday), as my wife and I are going on a 12 day vacation the UK in 11 days from now, and I wanted to make it more enjoyable. 

Coincidentally, and I guess fortunately, I woke up yesterday morning (2 hours before my epidural appointment) in agonizing pain, no matter whether I was laying, sitting or standing, Just a few positions offered the slightest bit of relief. My first attempt to get out of bed left me lightheaded from the pain, with pins and needles shooting down my leg, as well. I was incredibly anxious and confused, as I've never experienced anything like this before. 

My wife drove me to the epidural procedure (I was in the back seat, on all fours) and I told the doctor what was going on. He told me my back was spasming and aggravating the nerve. He said the epidural would hopefully offer relief, as it had for my pain the first time, told me to ice the area often, and prescribed hydrocodone. I have a few cyclobenzaprine left from when I had the sciatica, which he told me I could take, also.

The rest of the day was unpleasant, and I had to shift positions between various ways of laying and standing. Sitting normally in a chair is still difficult if not impossible from the pain. It's also now 6am, and I was only able to sleep on and off for a few hours, total. I'd wake up from pain, or from my body wanting me to change positions, which is incredibly difficult and painful.

So I'm now here, hoping for some stories of recovery from something like this. Can I expect this to clear up in a day or two? What if it doesn't? Should I go to the ER or urgent care for some sort of additional pain relief? I'm just feeling panicked, upset and helpless. If it comes down to it, we may have to cancel our trip to the UK. That would be incredibly upsetting but at this moment, all I want is for this pain to go away. I'm so incredibly tired but it feels impossible to get comfortable and feel relaxed, as my body is so tight and stressed and in pain. 

I'm 33 and in good health aside from this. My mom had herniated discs in her 20s and would throw her back out many times during her life. She told me yesterday she opted not to try surgery, and in most cases her episodes would go away in a day or two. I'm now terrified of this not only not going away but of it recurring again in the future. What advice can you offer to lower the chances of that happening? I can work from home if needed, so I have some relief as far my job goes, but a quick google search reveals some people can be like this for weeks or months, and that scares the hell out of me. I don't know how I'd handle that with my employer. 

Greatly appreciative for any advice or positivity you can throw my way.

595,Need Pain Relief on Subutex. Please Help,"Fellow redditors, please give me some advice here:

I have been having progressive back pain for the past 3 months. I got the MRI results about one month ago, which revealed degeneratice disc disease and joint facet hypertrophy. My lower back hurts so bad right now I feel like I am going to vomit and/or faint. I take 4-6mg of subutex, 600mg gabapentin, and meloxicam (forgot dosage) a day. I am debating on going to the ER, or try to find a chiropractor or pain management doctor that can see me tomorrow. Everyday seems to get worse and worse. I already feel like the MRI from one month ago is outdated, due to the difference in pain. I am willing to try ANYTHING.  I have insurance, but I don't know where to go or what type of doctor I should see. If I go to ER, I probably will be treated like trash because of subutex, and/or won't get adequate relief to combat buprenorphine binding. Where do I go?",

I'm a 23 year old woman and I've been having back pain for about three months just in the very lowest part of my back. Like the title says, it's a dull-ish pain when bending over (changing shoes, picking something up) and a very sharp pain when I sneeze. I've already made a doctor's appointment for this Friday, but I thought this might also be a good resource. I've been perusing the subreddit but have had a hard time finding something that matches my experience.

I have experienced no numbness, and no tingling. I have no pain in my legs or anything unusually happening in that region. There was no clear initial instigator of the pain, though I do suspect heavy lifting. At some point during this summer the pain had pretty much subsided, and then I caught a falling (heavy) suitcase on the stairs and that brought the pain from a 1.5 to maybe an 8 for the next couple of days and it's lowered a lot but wavers up and down from time to time.

I guess my questions are:
What are your theories on the cause of this back pain? 
For that theory what would be your advice?
Is there anything I should prepare or find out before my doctor's appointment to get the most out of it?

Thanks for any and all help! This subreddit has been very informative so far.",

Ive posted about it once or twice here but I was diagnosed with a LLD when I went to PT for low back pain. I definitely have gotten better over time but I felt like the exercises given to me seemed to be the same cookie cutter stuff to everyone and I was also given a heel lift to fix the LLD. Thing is I everyone say that heel lifts cause more problems than they fix. I got discharged so atm Im just doing the exercises I was given and playing basketball alone basically for cardio but my goal is to be able to get back to doing squats deadlifts etc. without hurting my back again.

Im still having back pain when sitting but I have a pretty nice steelcase leap chair that Ive tried to make as ergonomic as possible. Im just wondering if I should go back to the doctor to get another round of physical therapy with someone else. I just dont know if the PT I had was that great and they didnt really make any attempt to fix the LLD it just seems like the heel lift is a crappy bandaid. Am I right to be skeptical or should I assume my PT knew what he was doing. I just am wondering if his methods could be a bit outdated because hes pretty old (not trying to be a dick).

607,Need advice should I be worried my back pain is more than a muscle strain.,"I'm a  28 year old male with history of low back pain. I strained my back in highschool doing dead lifts while listening to bad coaching. Now every few years I'll strain my back on something simple as taking a shower, then the spasms will start. Usually the spasms slow down in the first couple days. The back strain will slowly go away over time. I am over weight but I'm working on losing weight. I am somewhat fit though and can still run a few miles with out stopping. 

&amp;nbsp;

The latest back strain in question started while brushing my teeth and leaning over the sink this last Sunday. The strain didn't feel as bad as others i've had but it get worse the next day after waking up. I went to the doctor on Monday and she prescribed orphenadrine, naproxen, and oxycodine on Monday. Back spasms still were bad on Wednesday, and after talking to doctor she prescribed prednisone for swelling. I've also been icing and using a tens unit. I was able to get on my feet for a little to get around the house. But still having issues sitting in straight back chair.

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday and today I noticed that my lower back will be really tight and sometimes I'll adjust how I'm sitting and my lower back will pop and be better. Later today My wife gave me a ride to the health clubs  pool to see if it will help me walking in it since my back seemed tight but wasn't spasming. I slowly got out of the van and was surprised that I'm walking almost like I would normally and had no pain. After 10 mins of walking in the pool and 10 minutes of just raising my knees one at the time, my back becomes strained but no spasm. I started feeling  tightness and fire going from the butt wrapping around to the front above my knee. I'm starting to think this beyond a muscle strain at this time.

614,"Lower back pain is making life really hard to enjoy at the moment, what do my symptoms sound like? [Need Advice]","Hi, i'm 18 and have had non-stop, ever increasing back pain for the last 18 months. Within the last 3 months I have visited an Osteopath twice, which has done nothing to alleviate the pain. 

My Observations-

* There seems to be two sources of pain. (1) is on the spine itself, and (2) is at the same vertical position as (1) but shifted to the right by about two inches, and feels like a muscle knot. I suspect one relates to the other in some way

* The Right side of my body has ever worsening problems- It started with a clicking right knee about 6 years ago, and since then my right shoulder joint, hip joint, neck, lower back and even a small muscle knot on my right jaw have been causing daily pain/ discomfort for me. I only noticed the asymmetry of my pain very recently, within the last 18 months because of the much more noticeable back problems.

* (1) feels like a painful lump on the spine itself that is aggravated by anything besides lying down. However, (2) still hurts when I lie down. its like a constant nagging ache in my back that feels the size of a golf ball, it feels like a joint that really wants to click but can't. 

* I've been trying to work out to strengthen my core and upper body but it's too painful. My back gets really sore and my shoulder joint clicks too much for me to lift.

* (This one might be a psychological thing, but still...) My right leg feels like it has been twisted in it's socket. The whole thing feels wrong in my body in a way that I can't explain. 

* The Osteopath was successful in making some of the joints in my back pop and some of the muscles on the right side of my body to loosen but hasn't been able to sort out the source of the pain. 

* I used to deliberately click my back a lot to alleviate the discomfort from long hours spent at a desk, so it's possible I damaged it from both of those activities.
 I still click the parts of my back that I can click, and sometimes get very frustrated in trying to click the part that I can't because it feels like I should be able to.

If this sounds like what you have and you know what it is or what I can do to fix it then please let me know. If you know anyone who might know what this problem is then please let me know, Thank you.",

I've had some back issues for years (I've pulled muscles, strained them, etc). But a few times I've experienced something that I experienced again this past Wed. I had done some work (lifting, bending over, etc. but nothing major) that day. Sat and watched TV for a bit, then layed down on my back in my bed for a bit before taking a shower. But as soon as I arose from the bed (or tried) I had intense pain in my back out of no where. It felt in my lower back, center and to the left. Hurt to sit on the edge of my bed and couldn't stand. Eventually I was able to stand with support. I could put weight on my right foot fine, but weight on my left caused my back to hurt a lot. With a few more mins I was able to slowly hobble around (bending over and twisting were avoided). 


Since then it's gotten better, but still feels tight/swollen sort of and I've been trying to take it easy as well as do some stretches and use an exercise ball. It's seems like it hurts the most when getting up from having layed down, but once I've been sitting or standing for a bit it feels ok (still hurts but not a gripping pain unless I bend over or twist or something). Occasionally I felt the pain in my left buttock sort of (when it was gripping it was coming from the center of my back, now it currently feels swollen and tight to the left of center, just above my butt.

Anyhow, it has gotten profoundly better in the last week, and I feel like my old self again. Last week, my lower back was really stiff and restrictive, then, on Tuesday, I started to feel better, but my left rump was most affected. Today, both my lower back and rump have, for the most part, been sensation-less. But after sitting for a short-moderate length of time, I have begun to get shooting cramping-like sensations in my left calf only upon standing. 

I know the idea is if you have leg pain/discomfort accompanying a bad back, the trick is to get all the pain to move up your leg and localize in your lower back. Mine is seemingly going the other way, but every day I feel better and less restricted. 

I am a wee bit concerned the cramping feeling on my left calf is in the neighborhood of my nasty, whorly varicose veins which many are aghast upon seeing. I have my yearly physical with my physician in early-Sept and I will bring this up to him then.

632,My experiences of getting treatment for back pain in China,"Hi all,

I thought I would quickly share my experiences of receiving treatment for back pain outside of my home country of England, specifically China, where I have lived for the past five years.

My experiences with Chinese medical care has not always been the best. Shortly after arriving here a friend passed away after a bout of severe food poisoning. He was taken back to USA for an autopsy and it was discovered that he passed from severe dehydration. He had been in hospital for several days so this should have been easily noticed and easily dealt with. Shortly after I returned back from a holiday in SE Asia with a mosquito bite that became infected. I saw several doctors, who prescribed very different drugs each time before I was given the correct treatment. Doc number 2 poked the weeping open wound with unwashed, ungloved hands and proclaimed ""looks ok!""

At this moment I should point out I have seen other, fantastic local physicians in China who have been of a great help to me, just these first two experiences left me with a lot of fears that I would not get the correct treatment if I had something seriously wrong with me.

Last summer I started experiencing back pain in my upper mid back, especially when seated. It got steadily worse until could not use my computer for more than half an hour. I put off going to see a doctor as I knew very little about spinal treatment, thought an operation may be needed, and I was worried about it going wrong.

Around March this year it got really bad, but this coincided with my business going through a phase of doing really well, and me having some extra cash.

On the recommendation of an associate, I saw a chiropractor at a private clinic. We did some xrays and discovered that I had two injuries in my back, one where the pain was, and one nearer my hips, and one in my neck. I sent the xrays to my GP back home to get her opinion, and she was in agreement.

I started on a chiropractic course, and my symptoms soon lessened. This may have also been because I was much more aware of keeping good posture, and other lifestyle improvements. I did have some reservations about the conveyor belt style system of seeing patients at this clinic, and some inconsistencies in what the chiropractor was telling me about my condition, but felt like I was getting better so set them aside.

Unfortunately about a month ago, after an adjustment I started feeling pain in my neck for the first time. I mentioned this to the chiropractor, but said it was likely a temporary thing, which seemed wrong to me.

Then a week ago we redid the xrays. The two back injuries looked better, but the neck looked worse in my eyes. I said this, but was assured there was a ""10% improvement"" and we should continue treatment. I said doing more of the same didn't seem logical.

I've taken my xrays to a few other specialists (both chiropractic and others) who agree that my neck looks worse. So I am now making a decision on what is next for my treatment. I'm a bit annoyed with the previous clinic, but at least my back is better and I'm taking steps to improve my health. I do miss the NHS back in England though!

Anyone else have experience of getting treatment for back pain overseas? I'd be interested in hearing.",
633,"Dealing with an ""out"" back when work makes it worse","I tweaked/threw out my lower back Sunday (not sure how...it just started hurting), but it wasn't terrible at the time, so I didn't think it was a big deal. Woke up Monday with nothing more than slight stiffness.

But then I spent two days sitting in my not-that-comfortable office chair, and now it's KILLING me. (Driving is even worse than just sitting, and my commute's about 40 minutes. I was about to jump out of my car after the first 10 this afternoon.) I can't easily take off at the moment, so just needing some advice on how to make it through the rest of my week, when I know going back for another 8-hour sit tomorrow will just make it worse. :-/ I caved in this afternoon and scheduled a massage for Friday evening, but I have to tough it out until then. (Actually, was that a good thing to do? It sounded like something that would help.)

What do you all do for this kind of pain? It feels like it's just muscular, but it definitely hurts, and it seems like it's spreading as more and more muscles around the area stiffen. Straightening up hurts, bending hurts, walking hurts...basically any movement hurts.

637,Lack of back pain?,"Hey all, here's the context. 

About a two months back, I was at a music festival and after having been walking around all day, my upper back muscles were killing me. During one of the sets, I was stretching out my back and I felt a pop at my lower back/hips. Immediately my muscles stopped hurting and I had newfound flexibility in my hips. Throughout the night, it felt like every joint popped at least once and there was a tingling sensation radiating out from my lower back to my ribs and up my back. 

Ever since, I've had a weird feeling in my lower back, but it's not pain. It's more like numbness and tingling, similar to having popped a really stiff joint. I don't get any pain now except for the numbness/tingling and my upper back sometimes feels like it needs to pop but won't. Another interesting thing is that I can now sit comfortably on the ground without my legs going numb, and when I lay flat on the ground I can now feel my full back against the ground, where I used to feel a gap between my tailbone and mid-back.

640,Severe lower back pain when sleeping,"Hi Reddit,

I am hoping someone can help me out. 

I am a 29 year old female, 5'5"", 115 lbs. I eat well, exercise 3 times a week, and am overall in good health/shape. I have a pretty strong core, drink plenty of water throughout the day, etc. etc. 

I have always suffered from back pain, mainly in the upper left ribcage/shoulder blade area. It waxes and wanes but over time I've discovered ways to try to keep it under control (exercise, heat, and just general mindfulness have seemed to help--but if anyone has any other ideas, great!). However, that's not why I'm here today...

Since February, so 6 months ago, I have started waking in the middle of the night (maybe around 3 AM or so) with extreme pain and tightness in my mid-lower back muscles. The pain seems to be in the area immediately surrounding the spine, and it is unbearable at times. It literally feels like someone is pulling apart my back with pliers. I typically fall asleep on my back and adjust in the night on one side or another (never stomach). When my back is in this severe pain, I cannot lay on my back--I can try to lay on my sides but often the pain is too severe to fall back asleep. The pain will typically subside within 1 hour of being up and moving around.

I am incredibly distraught and frustrated as at least with my more chronic symptoms (which are still ongoing), sleeping has always been comfortable and almost like a reset button for me. I purchased a new, high-quality mattress a few years ago which helped immensely with my chronic issues, and have not had any issues until now. The issue has become so bad that I fear I'm at risk of depression over it--I think ahead to the rest of my life and just don't know how to live with the pain.

Any advice??

643,Solutions for neck/shoulder/upper back pain?,"Hi all,
I've been having pain in my neck, shoulders, and upper back for the past few weeks. The pain is largely dull and achy, but in trying to relieve the neck pain through stretching, I've noticed some positions that cause a sharp pain (e.g., turning head to the left and bending neck backward). I'm 27 and work out about 3 times a week, and live a fairly healthy lifestyle. I'm naturally slim, I try to eat well, I take vitamins, and I get a solid 7-8 hours of sleep per night. I incorporate some yoga into my exercise warm-ups and cool-downs, and as I am flexible, stiffness is not usually something I experience. Despite lots of long nights hunched over a desk in grad school and at work, I've never had this kind of pain before, and the suddenness of the constant ache is concerning. I can't tie the pain to a specific workout, so I don't think I pulled or pinched something while exercising. I travel frequently for work, and I'm sure my heavy shoulder bag doesn't help the problem, but again, that's nothing new. Neck and shoulder stretches don't seem to help alleviate the pain, so I'm not sure what my next steps should be. Ibuprofen helps at the time, but it's not an actual solution. I've been making a conscious effort to maintain good posture while sitting at my desk, and I ordered a backpack to evenly distribute weight while traveling, but more advice would be helpful. One note - I'd rather not get massages or see a chiropractor, as I'm really not comfortable with anyone (aside from a specialist) manipulating my spine or the muscles surrounding it.

Apologies if this is not the correct subreddit for this - I know a few weeks isn't quite chronic, but wasn't sure where else to put this post.",
644,Acute Lateral L5 stress fracture -- help me out.,"I'm a 22 year old female. I've never had back pain or trouble before. For the past week, I've had some mild to moderate back pain. I thought I slept wrong or pulled a muscle. I had a CT done for an unrelated reason, I was going to have my gall bladder removed until this happened. The radiologist wrote on the report I have a lateral L5 stress fracture. I got these results Friday. 

I called ortho yesterday to schedule an appointment asap. Spine orthopod was booked solid and they actually ended up finding a doctor in sports medicine who would happily see me. He found the fracture on CT but he also did different angled X-rays and my physical exam was consistent with a fracture. There was controversy if it was just on my left side or bilateral. He had another physicians opinion and they both ended up agreeing I have just one on my left side which makes sense that's where the most intense pain is even though I do have some pain on my right side as well. 

He took a conservative approach and told me I HAVE to rest...a lot. When I do get up do to do things if I have any pain, that means I need to sit. He was against bracing me since it was only unilateral and he was concerned for muscles sake because of weakness. He doesn't expect me to feel better until about Labor Day if I don't overdo it fully healed 8-12 weeks. I see him again for a progress appointment in 3 weeks light PT might be prescribed then. 

I am noticing: 
- I have a hard time walking. My hip and pelvic bone are also being effected by this. I'm REALLY beginning to wonder if I tore a muscle attachment. 
- I have to keep my left leg straight. If I don't, my pain increases. 
- it hurts to sit. 
- I have to sleep on my recliner because it's too uncomfortable to lay down. 
- when I'm up and moving I'm tired out quickly and walk pretty slow. 
Overall having a hard time walking has me concerned and it's driving me crazy. My doctor told me that can be completely normal and not to worry too much. I just need to listen to my body overall and sit. 

I'm quickly learning back pain is the WORST. 

Has anyone had this or anything similar before? What was your experience like? Any input or recommendations would be appreciated. ",
645,"Backpain because of work, better but no good, should i go work tomorrow","In short: I (24/F) did on Saturday one shift of hotel housekeeping and my first shift of waitressing in a restaurant. Next day, Sunday, wake with some strong lower left back pain but manage to do an housekeeping shift. Towards the end of the shift I move very slowly almost crying of pain and go home hurting with muscle spasms. Today, free day, recovered a bit but still hurt. Should I tomorrow go housekeeping again? Is ibuprofeno/advil enough or should I get good first? Any other tips?

 

-----



Longer: I (24/F) have been an hotel housekeeper for more than a month now, 4-5days a week, 5-7hours a day. Most of the physical adaptation is done, sometimes something still hurts but paracetamol solves it. I was looking for a second job and did a test/training shift on a restaurant as a waitress. Note that before doing it I had a slight left lower back pain but normal after a shift. This was on Saturday and I did the test and got the second job! yey Sunday I wake up with the worst back (lower left) pain, I rub some tiger balm, take quite some paracetamol and go do a hotel cleaning shift. Towards the end of the shift (not a particularly hard or long) I could almost not move, bending was impossible and I wanted to cry from lifting myself. I arrived home and just sitting and getting up was crazy painful. Muscle spasms at almost all movements. Today (Monday) was a free day so I slept a lot, ate a lot, slept some more, tried to massage my back a bit, stretched a tiny bit. I am a lot better but still feel pain in most of the movements. I feel that if I take some anti-inflammatory medicine (ibuprofeno) I may be able to work tomorrow morning (Tuesday). 

I don't have so much experience with back pain, so maybe someone has suggestions or advice? Do you think I should risk getting the pain back to the worst again tomorrow? I really need the money (school fee+rent) so I would prefer not to miss work. Can my back heal itself even if I work? Will the ibuprofeno be enough or will I find myself moving like an old lady by middle of the shift? Any sharing of experience of suggestion accepted!


PS I dont know exactly if the pain is from the housekeeping or the waitressing, probably the combination with little resting time but for sure I know that all the bending and pushing while cleaning is very hard on the back and impossible in an acceptable timing if it really hurts.",

647,Advice on what what might cause my lower back pain/stiffness,"Some background: I’m a 25 y/o male, 168cm tall and weigh about 62kg (5’7” / 136lbs) with well-developed muscles for my size. I sit throughout a major part of my day and consider myself to be relatively stiff and inflexible - not a good combo, I know :(

I've been experiencing lower back pain/stiffness for about 2 months now that worsens with certain conditions/positions. Although the pain doesn’t hurt my ability to function generally, it’s become quite bothering for me since it’s always there to some extent (even when laying down). The pain is generally pretty dull, though it can get a bit sharp sometimes after staying in the same position (e.g. prolonged sitting). I can usually eliminate any sharp pain by moving around for a few minutes.
Other than the last 2 months, I’ve never had lower back pain or discomfort.

The position that seems to aggravate my lower back the most is letting my back arch backwards while sitting, aka ""slouching"". It's especially felt after standing or walking for a long period of time, after which my lower back tends to become stiffer, making it uncomfortable to not keep a straight back. I can generally hit the ""cat and cow"" yoga poses without pain, though there is a slight discomfort when accentuating the cat pose.

I've had x-rays of my lower back taken and went to see an orthopedic doctor. His diagnosis: I have very minor scoliosis (which I’ve also had as a kid) which he found to be very negligible. He didn’t see any other issues with my spine and suggested that it’s “probably one of my muscles” and said I could go back to doing whatever I was doing. I used to do deadlifts but stopped ever since this happened. Strangely enough, on my last training session I was feeling the pain when lowering the weight, rather than pulling it up. I should mention that I’ve been avoiding such exercises completely since they seem to aggravate the condition.

Has anyone experienced something similar to what I’m describing? What steps should I take at this point to improve (or hopefully eliminate) whatever it is that I have? Responses will be highly appreciated.",

659,Looking for some advice on an injury/strain,"In case it's relevant, I'm 21 years old, 5'7"", and decently athletic with no prior back issues. 

Starting around the 23rd of May, I began strenuous rehearsals with a very high octane marching band (specifically a drum corps, if anyone's heard of that) where I was wearing a large bass drum on a carrier that fit over my shoulders on and off for about a week, 12 hours a day. Starting the first day, my back was starting to legitimately give out, and my posture suffered as a result. My core would collapse, unable to support my upper back. I continued to practice way longer than I should have but eventually couldn't physically remain upright. Under pressure from staff and my own stubbornness, I continued to rehearse for the next week or so, my back giving out like this several times a day. Even standing still, I couldn't physically carry the drum longer than 5-10 minutes, which wouldn't have been an issue before this week. I was working with a physical trainer for my back several times a day on top of all this, but he wasn't actually able to diagnose anything--I just did stretches and a few ice baths. He did notice my hips were out of alignment, one leg being noticeably longer than the other, which was definitely not a thing before this week. I ended up having to withdraw from the group after 7 or 8 days of this for obvious reasons (losing the $3500 I payed in tuition). 

Throughout the week, I had constant pain and tightness in my lower back. It felt inflexible and heavy, like there was a big stone disc glued just under the skin. This lasted for a couple weeks after the fact. Now, it's more of a burning pain in my lower back mostly during extension (versus flexion). A few times a day what feels like my lower vertebrae will pop with enough volume to be heard across a room. 

I'll definitely get this checked out at some point, but the combination of losing my tuition and having not been working since I wasn't planning on being home until the end of August has left me struggling financially. As such, I don't want to go in now unless it's necessary I do so immediately. What I'd like to ask here specifically would be:

1) What sort of injury could have resulted from activity like this?

2) Disregarding pain/discomfort for the time being, with what sort of urgency should I get this checked out?

(no, I will not consider shipping it, sorry).  

**Some Background:** 
I have two bulging discs on my back (L4-L5 L5-S1) from an injury a few years back. The injury wasn't very serious (no surgery needed) but they flared up again last summer, causing me a lot of pain and getting an inversion table was one of the many things that I tried.

I wouldn't say the inversion table cured my back, as regular exercising and physical therapy helped the most in my opinion. But the inversion table definitely helped relieving my pain on days when I had some serious muscle spasms in my lower back. 

Fortunately, my pain is 90% gone now and I don't really use the inversion table anymore. I suppose there may be some advantage of continue using the inversion table, but I live in an apartment building and the inversion table is taking up too much my very limited living space.

It wasn't really an issue anymore and at the end of 2016 i worked out almost everyday, like i was even able to deadlift close to my 100% without any pain. But after the yearshift it went downhill in connection with a virus that lasted for two weeks. My physiotherapist said it was because I had been going to heavy in my lifts and recommended that i would Deload for sometime. I did (actually i did it twice in cycles of two weeks) but nothing changed. ""Maybe you just have to give it sometime"", he said but this was like in February he said this. I haven't been able to train like i want do for 6 months and it really hurts me because its my biggest passion. Right now I'm trying to figure out why I'm still getting the pain. I believe the biggest factor is my posture (especially when I'm sitting) but my physiotherapist says there is nothing to worry about it. Do you guys have any tips
and also in general how do you handle long term pain?",

For example, when i bent to tie my shoes and then i go into a straight position, my back hurts a lot but i can't pinpoint the exact location. When I'm seated for an extended period of time my back hurts too.



From Mid-November till February i lost 10kg, went from 103kg to 93kg (I'm 16, and I'm 184 cm tall). Would this weight loss affect my back? Because i didn't necessarily focus on my back while i was doing my workouts...

672,Burning in back (near shoulder blade),"Hi, I have had this back pain for years that surrounds my right shoulder blade (I am right handed). When I pull my arms back and the shoulder blades together I usually feel a pain on the right one at its lower edge.

674,Getting leg length surgery,"Hopefully my insurance pays 

Can someone tell me how do U measure a true leg length descrpancy?

But how do I know it doesn't change when laying down ether through out the day.

I think I have a .5 inch leg length that a pt told me laying down. I'm gonna get surgery to make both even

Is .5-1 inch enough to get one leg shortened?

682,Pain below collar bone,"Hey there!

I've also asked this question over on /r/askdocs

I posted a question a couple of days ago regarding this pain, but was unsure really what/where it was. I am now sure that it's being caused by a back injury/strain.

I'm a 22yo female, white, 125lbs, 5ft5. Not on any meds

The pain is just below the left side of my collar bone. When I touch the area it feels very tender and as if it's bruised. I have been experiencing this since Monday. It was almost unbearable Tuesday, and since then it has gotten slightly less painful, but I can still feel it constantly and it's making life difficult

I feel the pain when I breathe deeply, cough (I can't cough or sneeze bc it hurts too much), speak loudly, sleep on my side, move my left arm, bend forwards or sideways.

My upper back and neck also clicks/cracks very frequently now if I take a somewhat deep breath.

One week before experiencing these symptoms, I had to lift some very heavy bags for about half an hour, and my neck and shoulder muscles were very sore for the next day or two.

So, I'm wondering should I see a doctor (which I can't really afford ha), or does this sound like something that will clear up itself soon? I've done some stretches and have been foam rolling


Very grateful to anyone who takes the time to read this and has any thoughts or advice, thank you!",

688,Is it Lower Back Injury or Glute Injury?,"So I've been dealing with lower back pain / glute pain for a few years now.  It started with what I believe is series of gym injuries while lifting weights.  What usually happens is i'm doing an exercise, then I might notice a cracking sound followed by some intense sharp pain.  Sometimes, its just a little sore and painful after an exercise and then the following hours / day it will get progressively worse.  It's happened while doing deadlifts, squats and dumbell rows (and more recently just bending down as I will explain).  

I would typically take a week or two break and heal up and would feel perfectly fine and then continue my workout routine without any issues.   Then after another 6 months or a year later, it might happen again.  I ended up getting an MRI and turned out I have two herniated discs at the L5 and S1.  

So I stopping weight training all together and just did cardio for the past year and a half.  Fast forward to two weeks ago when I was doing a bit of gardening work and felt a bit of soreness in my back the day after.  Nothing crazy really so I took it easy and next day I felt fine.  The day after that though I was bending over with my knees bent (more like a squat really) and as I got back up I hear that crack again followed by the worst pain i've ever felt.  I couldn't walk for almost 5 days and was taking some serious pain killers as well.  Its been almost 2 weeks and I'm still dealing with some residual pain when I walk or sit down too much.  It's around my upper glute and just below my lower back area.  I have to do a lot of stretching throughout my day to get it loosened up. But this whole week I'll wake up to a lot of stiffness and some light pain which tends to get better after some stretching.  

My question is really about the nature of my injury.   I always thought it was a lower back injury but an article I read today made me think that it might be a glute injury because it stated that deep knee bends while lifting puts a lot of pressure on your glutes (even though it takes pressure off your lower back).  And thinking back on the moments where I've had an incident, it tends to happen when I am doing something that involves bending my knees.  Was wondering if others had the same experience or not and what seems to help for you?

690,Upper lumbar/lower thoracic pain: exercise/strengthen or no?,"Hello r/backpain,


I used the search, but couldn't find anything addressing my specific issue.


For a few months now I've been dealing with moderate back pain in the ""very center"" of my back. The pain is difficult to pin-point, and i even struggle to determine if it's skeletal or muscular. I was evaluated by a general doctor and he dianosed it as ""upper lumbar/lower thoracic strain"" but mentioned it could be a minor disk bulge, and to see a physical therapist for now.


I have really poor insurance, and I can't seem to find a PT in network to get me on the right track. I cannot afford to see a PT without insurance.


My biggest issue with this pain is that I need to sit in order to get work done, but sitting is the most uncomfortable position. I have a makeshift standing desk but I just can't seem to get down and productive using it. Sitting exacerbates the pain more than anything else. It's worth mentioning that it's also bad in the morning, and i'm a side sleeper that uses a pillow in between knees.
I'm not looking for ""see a doctor/PT"" recommendations, but I'm hoping there's someone on here that's had a similar problem that can recommend a course of treatment. I honestly don't know what I should/shouldn't be doing. i.e. should I do more core work, like planks, dead bugs, etc? Should I strenghten my lower back w/ one legged deadlifts or hypers? Should I avoid running even if it feels fine? Yoga? stretching? Foam rollings? Lax ball massage?


I'll do whatever it takes to not have this constant nagging pain.
Thanks",
691,Chronic back pain? Something else?,"Little back story: About 5 months ago I squatted down to pet my dog and got a sharp pain in my lower back, right along the right side of my spine. I was able to move/walk without issue afterward but did feel pain when bending over and sitting down/standing up. The following morning I still felt the pain but it wasn't much of a bother. Then, while dressing, I bent down slowly and got the same sharp pain as the morning before - but this time around it persisted and even hurt to move or walk. I managed to get to work but then left early and went to an urgent care. They said it seemed like a strain or sprain and gave me an anti-inflammatory drug and a steroid shot to help ease the pain. That night I got a heating pad and started using that. The following morning I was still having difficulty with pain while walking and still could barely lean forward a few inches without feeling a sharp pain. I took it easy all day and used the heating pad. Within a few days the pain went away.

---------------------------

I was fine for a few weeks but then every so often I began to feel pain in that area again. It has continued to happen over the last few months. Sometimes it is a sharp instant pain if I move a weird way like when turning over in bed. Sometimes it lingers a bit and is more of a dull pain - like this past weekend after I went on a hike. 

Should I go get it x-rayed and checked out or does this just sound like it is still from the sprain/strain? I am trying to avoid a hospital visit - especially if they are just going to tell me to use my heating pad.",

698,Leg Discrepancy and shoe lift... what now?,"I previously had severe back pain, which was determined to result from a leg discrepancy (in excess of an inch). My spine doctor and physical therapist said to put enough shoe insert until my waistline is no longer slanted. So, I did just that and it worked after one day (mind you, I was in pain for several months). I went from being unable to sleep and total loss of appetite to functioning quite normally. A month has passed since getting the insert, but it hasn't totally cured the pain. There is some lingering tightness in the middle of my back. It's not unbearable like it used to be, but it's still frustrating and fatiguing (as pain usually is). The longer the day goes, the tighter it gets. Sleep relieves it, but I work 10-12 hour days and the pain CAN get pretty bad. Would anyone have suggestions as to what I could do next? How to eliminate the residual pain. Or relieve it?

Things I've tried that DON'T help: Prescription grade anti-inflammatories, OTC pain relievers and anti-inflammatories, prescription muscle relaxants, ice packs, stretching (sometimes makes it worse), 

Things I've tried that DO help: Kratom (but I can't use that it work, because I drive a lot for work and it can make you doze off), sleeping on my back",

709,Stores to try out a large variety of good desk chairs?,"Hi,

I know that sitting is bad, and that no chair is perfect, yada yada yada...

I have to sit at work a LOT.  I'm not ready to try a standing desk.  I don't have the core strength yet to stand all day, maintaining good posture, and avoiding muscle fatigue.  I will occasionally work at a job site where I do put my laptop on something tall and stand at it, and within a few hours my back is stiff and killing me.

I recently started physical therapy, which has helped.  I also adjusted the position of the seat in my car and started using a soft jacket rolled up for lumbar support, and I've found that a half hour in the car in the position actually improves my pain dramatically.

So now I'm looking at my office chair.  I'm short, at 5'5"", so I have some limitations.  My regular chair has a seat that is too long.  If I sit forward far enough that my legs can bend properly, there is a gap between my back and the backrest.  I end up leaning back into the backrest, which is just awful.  If I try to scoot back so that my back meets the rest, I can't maintain that position and within a few minutes I've slid forward into the above mentioned position. 

We've got some other chairs in a conference room that work better.  The seat is the right size, and it's actually got pretty good lumbar support.  However, it reclines a tiny bit too much for me, and doesn't seem to have a way to lock the recline.

So I'm hoping to find a place where I can go sit on a bunch of chairs and pick one that works best for me.  Again, I know being a ""good chair"" is like winning the tallest midget contest.  Not the point.  Point is, I would like to try to find something better than what I've got.

Any recommendations on a good store for this?  I'm in Chicago, so probably just about every option is available to me.

Thanks. ",
710,"Experiencing severe back pain, considering getting a kneeling chair.","I am a 20 year old male student in the UK, about 5' 10"" and weighing ~71kg. For the last several years I've had sporadic back pain from time to time. I have been a very heavy PC gamer for most of my life, and while younger would spend hours at a time sitting in front of a computer, presumably with bad posture which has led to experiencing pain in more recent years. Usually it's not too bad, or goes away after some time. 

I also have pronated (I think, might be misremembering) feet, and have found that being barefoot, or even sitting barefoot, leads to greatly increased pain, and thus I always wear shoes, even indoors, with insoles in them ([these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Scholl-Orthaheel-Regular-Orthotic-Medium/dp/B003ASYE4C)). When sitting at my PC, I also sit on a [Sissel sitfit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sissel-23902-Sitfit-Plus-blue/dp/B000W8K4QK) cushion, like [so](http://i.imgur.com/qTxeTBQ.jpg). These measures appear to help.

However, recently the pain has been getting worse and more consistent, to the point of severely impacting my life. I struggle to sit for any length at all without back pain, and also end up hurting whenever I sit in another context (on a sofa, in a lecture hall, etc), though pain doesn't occur immediately when sitting on a normal chair. Over the last few days, even lying down on a relatively firm surface doesn't seem to help. It's at the point that I need to make a change and try something, as this is getting to be too much. I've heard good things about kneeling chairs (such as [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ergonomic-Kneeling-Chair-Pneumatic-color/dp/B00ASXUH0W/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495109783&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=kneeling+chair)), and am thinking of trying one. Thus I wish to ask, do they work, and if so, what sort of price range ought I to consider, are there any specific brands that are good, and so on. Would such a chair work to fix my back problems, or would I need to do more on top of that?

After a couple of weeks the pain went away so I resumed my regular worksouts but immediately (day of) i started feeling pain so I stopped and since then my lower / left side of the back has been hurting. 

I went to a PT and a chiropractor. the latter was useless but the PT said my core is too weak so to do exercises for that. 

I finally was able to start working out again beginning of april and it's been fine. I can rock climb, i can run, etc but the thing I cannot do it stand for long periods of time. For example, going to a concert is too much for my lower back when just standing there. I need to either be sitting or walking/moving. therefore, doing one of my fave hobbies (baking) is difficult and I have a stool in the kitchen now. 

aside from standing, the other times i feel back pains (more of a soreness) is when i wake up in the morning. The one thing that made me not be sore in the morning was getting a hammock , briefly, for sleeping. the next morning i didnt feel any soreness/pain (but returned it bc i got shitty sleep bc i couldnt fall asleep on my side in the hammock [i'm a side sleeper])

My doctor prescribed me oxycodone and I had an injection of toradol. She pretty much said there was nothing more I could do about it.

After that flare up I haven't really experienced any pain up until the last two weeks. I now have sever lower back pain only at night while I'm lying in bed. It feels as though my back is stuck and I have to force it to move. I went back to the doctor and she told me that perhaps  I am just depressed which makes it seem worse than it is. She advised me to use heat packs and increase my SSRIs. This has offered no help to me at all. Last night I was in tears unable to get out of bed to use the toilet.

Anyone here who has back pain and is considering steroid injections or surgery should read this book before thinking about doing ANYTHING.

I've had two steroid injections and one back surgery (microdiscectomy).  Neither of them helped.

728,"Something that's helped me with my lower back pain, maybe it'll help u?","I was listening to JRE (Joe Rogan Experience) and he was taking about hanging from pull up bars. I have one of those bars u put in the doorway and have been hanging almost daily. 

It comes with like 3 different grips and I try to use each one. Basically I just hold on and hang there. I focus on my breathing and trying to have my butt or hips hang as much as possible. 

Breath in; tense up getting ready to ""hang."" 
Breath out; really try to loosen up my lower back and hang. 

My feet touch the floor but I kinda curl them so that I can still have my back loosened up. 

It's really helped me especially cuz I sit a lot and feel almost no pain when I'm sitting. Hopefully it helps u guys! 

I eventually want to invest/ DIY build/ or join a gym that has a reverse hyper. I've never tried it but it's supposed to do wonders. ",

732,Sciatica: muscular or disc or something else?,"I have been suffering from a bad lower back for over 6 months now. I have seen a couple of Dr's and been to a PT for 4 months; I am currently waiting on an MRI.

Unfortunately, the PT seemed to just guess at what was causing the issue: Piriformis, SI joint, herniated disc. The exercises I was provided were contradictory: ""don't stretch your hamstrings""....""you need to stretch your hamstrings"" ... ""you shouldn't be stretching your hamstrings"".

I get an ache in my SI joint on the RHS; my right glute is super tight when standing up (from sitting or lying - takes a few minutes to get ease up) and the slump test causes sciatica down my right leg. I also get a muscle pulling sensation in my right glute area - feels like it is perhaps the piriformis or maybe the hamstring insertion point. If I do a [standing McKenzie exercise](https://edzcelperk.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/backpa2.jpg) then I get pain in my right glute/lower back and down my right leg, however, doing the exercise when lying down I get no pain - I assume my hips must not be aligned correctly when standing. A cat-camel stretch causes pain in both flexion (muscle pulling sensation in glute) and extension (sciatica) both in the right leg.

The worst pain, however, is a deep and painful ache in my left leg. It comes about when I stand or walk for 5 minutes or so and it doesn't go away until I either sit down for a good period of time or I lie down and curl up. The PT always ignored this pain and said it was muscles adapting but after 5 months of having this pain I beg to differ.

I have thought I may have APT but am unsure if that would cause all the issues I'm having. I do have snapping hip (internal) on the right hand side.

I have been doing a multitude of exercises but am just completely unsure if they are helping or hindering. After 6 months I am no closer to knowing what is wrong and how to fix it.

Perhaps my symptoms are clear to someone with more experience?

Thanks in advance.


Edit: spelling.


**Update:** So after 3 weeks I have a little update. I have not yet had an MRI but the Dr's have sent a referral to the MRI department - I have also requested a quote for a private MRI. Nevertheless, I have had somewhat of a breakthrough after seeing a PT teacher. After 15 minutes or so he said that he thinks I have a disc issue but also that my SI joint is ""locked"" and twisted, that is, the right hand side has rotated forward. Anyway, he did some pretty hard pushing from the front of SI joint on the RHS. The next 48 hours were as usual - painful; however, after that I have not had a **single** bout of the severe ache and weakness I was getting in my left leg - not one. I still get the sciatica pain and tightness in my right leg and lower back - but the worst pain in my left leg has gone (at least, for now). Does anyone know what could have been causing this pain?",

HISTORY: LT SIDED LBP RADIATING TO SI joint, hip, LT LEG 
 
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal STIR, T1 and T2 imaging.  Axial T1 and T2 imaging.wdd
 
FINDINGS: The upper lumbar spine is normal. The patient does have a
congenitally somewhat narrow central canal.
There is disc degeneration at L4-5 and especially at L5-S1.
At L4-5 there is mild to moderate circumferential bulging that
minimally indents the thecal sac.
 
At L5-S1 there is moderate disc narrowing and desiccation, and there
is discogenic change with a Schmorl's node of the inferior endplate of
L5. The possibility of slightly more pronounced endplate fracture is
also considered. The disc has a moderate bulge and a small central
subligamentous extrusion that is slightly eccentric towards the left.
This however only minimally indents the thecal sac. The disc abuts but
does not compress or displace the S1 nerve roots which exit normally.
 
The neural canals are patent.  The spine is well aligned.   The bone
marrow signal is otherwise within normal limits. The cord appears
normal and has normal signal.  The visualized paravertebral soft
tissues are within normal limits.    
 
IMPRESSION: Degenerative disc disease especially at L5-S1 where there
may be an inferior endplate fracture or at least a Schmorl's node.
There is a small central disc extrusion at L5-S1 that just abuts the
neural elements as described.

739,"This is a new kind of pain for me, and it's led to 2 sleepless nights in a row","It is Thursday May 4 at 5:29 am. I have been awake since Tuesday May 2 at 7 am. I cannot sleep because I have some kind of sciatica caused by a back injury while squating at the gym. My back issues date back to when I was 18, when I herniated a disc to then, 6 years later, have an operation to remove part of that l4 l5 disc that was pinching my siatic nerve. This time it feels different, however. A month and a weeks long honeymoon later, after that fateful squat Monday, I went to the doctor. She prescribed me steriods, an anti-inflammatory, and I ate then as directed. I am very familiar with this kind of back pain. The need to move tenderly and intentionally for fear of aggrevating the discs any further. But upon waking up on Tuesday morning I was greeted with a new pain, a less familiar version. I had numbness, more like pins and needles on the left side of my foot, a general dull, lingering and painful ach accompanies. The same sensation moves up the outside of my calf and into my knee. Its very difficult to walk, sit, stand and most of all, lay. It is because of this pain that I cannot sleep. I called my doctor Tuesday morning to tell them this new and terrible news. They instructed me to keep taking my medicine and wait to get the MRI we all set up through insurance, and then come back to evaluate the damage. So I go to work and try to maintain nomalcy. Tuesday night consists of trying to sleep in bed, moving to the couch .. No success. I ended up falling asleep, sitting up at about 5am, to be awoken by my beautiful wife at 6 am (oh, and it's her 30th birthday). Wednessday was a sick day for me, as walking and just functioning at any level with that amount of sleep is nearly impossible. So it was a rest day, with the occasional lap around the parking lot so Jerry the dog can try to Chase squirrels and pee on everything that is leg-lift-high. Cut to the afternoon where I get a call to have an MRI at 9 pm (i guess we won't be having birthday dinner tonight, sorry baby). I also went ahead and set an appointment to review the results with my doctor the next day at 3 pm. Well as I said before, I got this injury squating. I compete, no very well, in powerlifting. I am a large person, 6'1"" and 270 lbs. I did not fit in the MRI machine ... Ugh. Even if I was to fit, there is no possible way I could lay there for the needed 20 minutes to take the pictures. If I could lay still for 20 minutes, I would be sleeping. The tech was nice enough and offered a spot at their other facility, which had a larger machine, for tomorrow, Thursday, at 11 am. And then it was time for bed, or so I had hoped. Its 12:30 am and I cannot find any relief. Any position I get into the pain intensifies. I decide to go to the er to see if maybe they can shoot me full of something and send me off with a script. That they did, and nothing has really improved. It is now 5:49 am and I just watched the sun come up. Another completely sleepless night. Appointments at 11 and 3, don't think I will be going into work again today. This is leading down a slippery slope. I think if I can just get some sleep tonight, I should be able to work. I will just be in some pain and disscomfort. My wife will be up, still worried about me, in about 11 minutes. Pharmacy opens in 2 hours, I hope these muscles relaxers do something. Ugh Wtf am I gonna do?",

-Father had degenerative disc disease, I played rugby in high school and lifted quite a bit. 


-Woke up March 2016 with a horrific pain down my legs and thought it was a pulled hamstring


-Did not get it checked until July, was diagnosed with DDD and a severe herniated disc


-Went through epidurals and chronic pain for a total of 9 months before receiving surgery


-Having chronic pain drained me physically and mentally, lost 10 pounds over the course. Abdominal muscles deteriorated as did a majority of my leg muscle.


-Got hooked on the pain pills, not touching the stuff ever again.


-Currently finishing my last set of PT appointments, I have gained back my abdominal and leg muscles.


-I can sit,walk,sleep comfortably but still have a bit of nerve tension due to my spinal chord being pinched for months.

Let me know if you have any questions about the surgery or my experience! Or maybe just some helpful words from someone who has gone through it!",

744,Help in understanding,"I have a relative who is in chronic back pain due to deteriorating discs. He has had fusion of at least 3, and is constantly rupturing more, and describes his spine as ""crumbling."" He is approx 45 years old, and addicted to extremely high dosages of opiates and anti-anxiety meds. He also suffers from depression -- understandably. 

So now his wife is divorcing him, and I am just wondering what kind of hope there is for him? He is moving to the DC area, and is not the kind of guy that will go for natural methods (like yoga, etc.). I just see him as having spiraled down into this pit, and wonder if there is any way out for him? Between the addiction and the pain, it just seems so hopeless.

Also, as someone not going through it though, I can't tell if his hopelessness about the physical situation is appropriate. Do people's backs just disintegrate? If so, is anything coming down the pipes (like stem cell research) that might offer some relief? I don't doubt that his pain is real, but he is terribly addicted to his medicine (and was a committed alcoholic before this happened) so I can't tell if the hopelessness is partly caused by his fear of being without his medication and the resulting pain. But honestly you guys, he is living in a kind of hell.

749,Lower-Back Pain: Tips to help you out,"I just wanted to share a few tips with those who are suffering from back pain. I myself have experienced it and I've managed to take control over it thanks to these tips.
My back pain came from sitting down for long hours studying. This may be also your case as I'm aware many people are required to sit down for long periods of time during their work. To avoid back pain one must be aware of his posture at all times. Most chairs aren't designed to support the back and that is what causes pain in our backs and it is constantly being strained while we sit without us knowing. So follow these tips:
1. Put your shoulders down and back. This will straighten the whole spine.
2. Make sure you are tucked in to the very back of the seat at all times. Don't slouch!
3. Keep your abdomen a bit tight/ flexed

If you feel that you need a bit of extra support or that its a bit hard to stay aware of all these things at all times, fear not as there are other options. You may want to purchase a backrest. These fit perfectly in the lumbar curve of the back and they can be fitted onto almost any chair.

769,24F Inflamed Disc pain...,"Background: I was pole dancing for 3 years, around 4-5 days a week, for a couple hours each session. Very physically fit. 
I originally noticed the pain in my mid back about a year and a half ago, and went to doctor after doctor, before being sent for an X-ray, which showed nothing. MRI (CT?) came next, which showed nothing but very minor scoliosis. So I came away with the conclusion that my disc is not herniated, but inflamed, due to too much training on one side, versus not enough on the other.

Fast forward a year and a half, and I had been doing ok, but no where near pain free. But then I woke up one morning with terrible pain. Thankfully, that day I got in to see an RMT for a gentle massage, which helped a bit, but I'm still in a lot of pain.

My question is, have you been through this? What did you do to combat the pain, aside from taking muscle relaxants/pain killers? Are you able to do normal, physical things (any sort of physical activity...not just lifting anything more than 3lbs) without feeling like death after/during?

772,Understanding MRI results and help with what to ask spinal doctor,"Hi All- I have been suffering moderate to servere back pain for probably a year. All lower back, radiates through buttocks and sometimes hips and thighs. Because of a history of ovarian cancer I was sent for a MRI - and discovered a back issue. The MRI for the back section reads:

""Disc bulge at L5-S1 level, white abuts the central thecal sac without significant spinal canal narrowing, and contacts the exiting right nerve root at this level.""


Could someone dumb this down and explain what this means?


I see a spinal doctor in a couple days. This MRI was a pelvic/abdominal MRI that just happened to find that. Do you think I will have another MRI or CT to get a better look at the spine? It seems very vague and not much detail.

Is a disc bulge the same thing as a herniation? I want to ask if I am better off trying noninvasive measures and for how long, before deciding if it's helping or not. I also have no relief from ibuprofen so as reluctant as I am for painkillers- I need SOMETHING that will help me on the days my back pain nearly prohibts me from walking and I cannot stand up straight from the pain, and it has me nearly in tears. Would a muscle relaxant or other type of nonnarcotic be an option?

The back pain has really affected my quality of life severely. The other complication, of steroid shots are suggested, is I live 80 miles from the nearest spine specialist and the small clinic in my town couldn't do those injections so I would have to miss work to go get a shot 80 miles away. Super annoying.

I've had chronic back pain since I was 15. The reasons for my pain are moderately complex and beyond the scope of this post. One major contributor, however, is inflammation. Of all of the treatments I've explored over the decades the best, by far, is Meloxicam. 

Meloxicam is an NSAID so if medications like Motrin work for you a little bit at high doses, (like they did for me), you may find that Meloxicam (gen. mobic) helps significantly more.

Meloxicam comes in 7.5 and 15mg pills. I take one 15mg per day and have for years. It cuts my daily pain by about 30% and I am aware of no side effects.

Ask your doctor. I hope it helps you!",
